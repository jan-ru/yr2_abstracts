<p>It may be tempting for researchers to stick to incremental extensions of their current work to plan future research activities. Yet there is also merit in realizing the grand challenges in one’s field. This paper presents an overview of the nine major research problems for the Business Process Management discipline. These challenges have been collected by an open call to the community, discussed and refined in a workshop setting, and described here in detail, including a motivation why these problems are worth investigating. This overview may serve the purpose of inspiring both novice and advanced scholars who are interested in the radical new ideas for the analysis, design, and management of work processes using information technology.</p>

<p>The case(s) demonstrates the importance of business process management (BPM) and business intelligence systems (BIS) in achieving better firm performance. It has been well documented in the literature that research on the effectively usage and combination of knowledge from BPM and BIS in turbulent service environments is limited. In response, we conduct an exploratory comparative case study of four firms in banking and telecommunication industries that have implemented BPM initiative and BIS solution. Our results firstly highlight that actual results of applying BPM and BIS differ greatly from the results that were originally planned. Secondly, we find that BIS initiatives are usually driven by improving marketing and sales, while BPM initiatives are driven by improving business processes. Thirdly, we identify that there is a lack of strong commitment to using both systems for supporting performance management.</p>

<p>Business process management: a missing link in business education Ravi Seethamraju (2012) Business Process Management Journal 18(3), pp.&nbsp;532-547, Emerald Publishing Limited, ISSN 1463-7154, cited by 66 (6.00 per year)</p>

<p>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse the inadequacies of current business education in the context of “process”. It presents an analysis of the background to business processes in historical perspective and posits the significance of business management for today’s business education. It argues the importance of business processes and business process management (BPM) in the context of the current and emerging information technologies (IT) and business education and highlights its ability to offer a missing link between business, IT and strategy. Design/methodology/approach The approach involves analysis and review of the literature and analysis of secondary data. Findings Even though business processes have been the subject of formal study from multiple perspectives for a long time, since the start of industrial age, processes still are not well understood, left unmanaged and poorly executed. With business schools teaching primarily function specific and narrow and IT schools focused on narrow technical skills, learning and understanding “process view” and “integration” is left to the individual student or academic, this study observes. It posits the significance of BPM and highlights its ability to provide the missing link to business education. It reports on the strategies employed by business schools and discusses the challenges in BPM education. Research limitations/implications Recognising the importance of BPM by business schools and embedding the BPM concepts and tools in a unified integrated curriculum across the business school with an inter‐disciplinary focus is challenging for business schools. Further studies, investigating how practitioners perceive this gap and on the effectiveness of different strategies of teaching BPM, are important. Practical implications These findings will help practitioners in understanding the gap between university education and practice and to develop appropriate training and development strategies. Originality/value The paper provides an analysis of the concept of “process” from an historical perspective and posits BPM as a missing link in business education that delivers “integration” and “process orientation” to business students.</p>

<p>The management of risk in business processes has been the subject of active research in the past few years. Potentially, many benefits can be obtained by integrating the two traditionally separated fields of risk management and business process management, including the ability to minimize risks in business processes by design and to mitigate such risks at run time. While there has been an increasing amount of research aimed at delivering such an integrated system, these research efforts vary in terms of scope, goals, and functionality. Through the systematic collection and evaluation of relevant literature, this article compares and classifies current approaches in the area of risk-aware business process management in order to expose and explain current research gaps. The process through which relevant literature was collected, filtered, and evaluated is also detailed. Finally, a research agenda is proposed.</p>

<p>Business process management: a maturity assessment of Saudi Arabian organizations Omar Alshathry (2016) Business Process Management Journal 22(3), pp.&nbsp;507-521, Emerald Publishing Limited, ISSN 1463-7154, cited by 15 (2.14 per year)</p>

<p>Purpose – Business Process Management (BPM) has become increasingly common among organizations in different industries. There is very limited research on the application of BPM in the MENA region and particularly in Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical maturity assessment for selected Saudi Arabian organizations from broad range of industries. Findings showed that there is notable variability of BPM perception within the functional groups of the sample organizations. Organizations with holistic business strategy and resilient change management procedures showed more adherence to BPM practices than those with functionally driven or ad-hoc BPM initiatives. Design/methodology/approach – In this empirical study, structured interviews were undertaken with selected business functions owners from ten Saudi organizations. All selected organizations resides in the city of Riyadh with most of them having local and regional branches. The selection of the organization followed non-probability sampling technique whereby the selected organizations were those seemed easy to access and showed willingness to participate in the research. The sample organizations included different types of businesses in different industries. Even though the purpose of the study is not applicable to a particular industry type or sector, variety of business domains and variability in organizations size were considered in the selection process. Table 1 shows an overview of the organization business sector. Findings – This research investigates the current status of BPM implementation among Saudi Arabian organizations. Although there is positive favour towards BPM concepts among Saudi organizations, it seems that the practical understanding of BPM is yet to be matured. One of the noticed findings from the survey is the apparent sharp disjoint between information technology (IT) and business strategy. This segregation, from a BPM perspective, created two variants of BPM understanding; a business variant related to designing and managing business operations, and the IT one which focusses on configuring and installing BPM systems. There is a lack of a holistic view of business processes and its associated activities within an organization. Most surveyed organizations have either no clear business strategy or it is too complicated the thing that make it difficult to integrate it with BPM initiatives. Some organizations have no defined process owners for their main core business processes neither there are measurable goals for their performance. Their main BPM endeavour is mainly focused on the process activities rather than the process output and performance. Originality/value – This is the first research paper that provides empirical research on the status of BPM in the MENA region and particularly in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Business Process Management Skills and Roles: An Investigation of the Demand and Supply Side of BPM Professionals Patrick Lohmann, Michael zur Muehlen (2015) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp.&nbsp;317-332, ISSN 0302-9743, cited by 12 (1.50 per year)</p>

<p>Business Process Management (BPM) as a discipline covers a wide spectrum of tasks, from the definition of strategic process objectives to the technical implementation of process execution infrastructure. This paper compares and contrasts the process roles demanded by industry with the backgrounds of BPM professionals. We perform a content analysis of advertised job positions in order to compare the skill sets demanded by industry with those found in an extensive study of BPM practitioner profiles. Our findings suggest several discrete roles: Chief Process Officer, Process Owner, Process Architect, Process Consultant, and Process Analyst. We find that while consultants and analysts are the most sought-after positions, they also represent the largest pool of available BPM professionals on the market. Roles that indicate a higher level of maturity such as Process Architects are solicited much less frequently, but are used by job seekers as advertising labels. We find Chief Process Officers to be a desirable role from an organizational maturity perspective, but also the rarest and highest qualified role on the supply side. Our findings provide initial insight for BPM education programs and potential BPM career trajectories.</p>

<p>AbstractBusiness process management (BPM) has emerged as paradigm for integrating business strategies and enterprise architecture (EA). In this context, BPM implementation on top of web-service-based service oriented architectures is an accepted approach as shown by great amount of literature. One concern in this regard is how-to make BPs reactive to change. Our approach to the problem is the integration of business rule management (BRM) and BPM by allowing modeling of decisions hard-coded in BPs as separate business rules (BRs). These BRs become EA assets and need to be exploited when executing BPs. We motivate why BPM needs agility and discuss what requirements on BPM this poses. This paper presents prototyping work conducted at a BP modeling and analysis vendor which weeks to showcase how using business rule management (BRM) as a mean for modeling decisions can help achieve a much sought-after agility to BPM. This prototype relies on the integrated modeling of business rules (BRs) and BPs, and rule deployment as web services part of an SOA.KeywordsBusiness Process ManagementBusiness Rules ManagementService Oriented ArchitectureAgility</p>

<p>Business process management enabled compliance-aware medical record sharing Jovan Stevovic, Jun Li, Hamid Reza Motahari-Nezhad, Fabio Casati, Giampaolo Armellin (2013) International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management 6(3), p.&nbsp;201, Inderscience Publishers, ISSN 1741-8763, cited by 6 (0.60 per year)</p>

<p>Data sharing about electronic health records (EHRs) across healthcare organisations is still a challenging task due to compliance requirements with regulatory policies that can vary across states and countries, and organisations’ internal business requirements. Even when adopting the same regulatory policies, each organisation can interpret and implement these policies and requirements differently in its internal IT environments. This paper proposes a compliance-aware data management solution for EHR systems. It allows healthcare organisations to define their own security and regulatory compliance requirements for accessing and sharing healthcare data, and enables policy enforcement while sharing data with other organisations. The policy requirements are expressed in the form of business processes that govern the access and sharing of data between people and systems. The business process operations are mapped into low-level operations on internal and remote record stores and policy enforcement points. We have implemented a prototype system that supports the proposed approach and integrated it with OpenMRS, an open source electronic medical record system, using which we have defined and enforced some real-world regulations and organisations’ policies for data sharing.</p>

<p>Business process management to date has not explicitly focused on sustainability as a change objective or driver. Although, approaches relating BPM and Sustainability already exist, e.g.&nbsp;Green BPM is the sum of all management activities that help to monitor and reduce the environmental impact of business processes in their design, improvement, implementation, or operation stages, as well as lead to cultural change within the process lifecycle. The intention behind Green BPM is the incorporation of environmental objectives into the management of business processes. To achieve this objective, BPM has to be extended by ecologically oriented complements, as are the consideration of environmental strategy as a part of the process strategy, or the awareness for energy consumption and pollution. Together with an earlier article consolidates several contributions of the BPM foundations in three underlying process change traditions: (1) the Quality Control tradition, (2) the Business Management tradition, and (3) the Information Systems (IS) tradition. These three traditions propose different approaches to business process change and each emphasizes some practices over others. Currently, there is a tendency of combining the various traditions in a comprehensive BPM approach.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that business process management (BPM) has added tremendous value to organizations in virtually every industry. By utilizing business process management systems (BPMS), organizations can streamline and automate tasks, reduce turnaround time, and help ensure regulatory compliance. The foremost considerations when enterprises deploy BPM solutions involve supportive system functions, friendly graphical user interfaces (GUI) and maximal return on investment (ROI), based on the specific processes required, organizational management, and working style of their particular business environment. In order to address the problems associated with BPMS customization, for the flexible coverage of various requirements, this paper takes a three step approach. First, limited customization support of commercial and academic BPMS is reviewed in favor of open source BPMS. Then, advantageous features of uEngine, an open source BPMS which supports flexible customization, are introduced. Finally, API-based and component-based customization in building a BPM application utilizing uEngine is introduced with illustrative examples.</p>

<p>In the modern business scenario, organizations are vesting high efforts in managing process sustainability as part of their operations management practices. The global environmental concerns for the welfare of the society have facilitated this change. Research studies have reported Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as one of the prerequisites in developing and maintaining efficient business processes. The process sustainability related initiatives and various processes related regulatory compliances have created the need for sophisticated IT tools like BPM (Business Process Management) and BI (Business Intelligence) in organizations. Thus with the advancement of ICT, a strong desire to enhance the business process performance through BPM and BI applications is felt across organizations. However, there is scant research available on leveraging the advantages of these applications in sustainability development. Therefore, this paper aims to present a conceptual architecture framework using an integrated BPM and BI solution to develop an orientation among practitioners and academicians towards the inclusion of ICT in attaining a sustainable, energy efficient business operations or processes. The framework is based on the literature pertaining to the role of BPM and BI in process sustainability as well as from the inputs of practitioners involved in the field of BPM and BI.</p>

<p>Because of the competitive economy, organizations today seek to rationalize, innovate, and adapt to changing environments and circumstances as part of business process improvement efforts. The strength of blockchain technology lies in its usage as an apt technology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes; furthermore, it prevents the use of erroneous or obsolete data and allows sharing of confidential data securely. The use of superior technology in the execution and automation of business processes brings opportunities to rethink the specific process itself as well. Business processes modeling and verification are essential to control and assure organizational evolution, therefore, the aim of this paper is three-fold: firstly, to provide business process management patterns in finance, based on blockchain, specifically for the loan-application process in the banking industry and claim process in the insurance industry that could be used and customized by companies; secondly, to critically analyze challenges and opportunities from the introduction of such approach for companies, and thirdly, to outline how companies can implement the loan business process as a web service. Partner companies (a bank and an insurance company) formulated the potential requirements for M2P along with the application of blockchain technology. An experimental design framework was established that gave the necessary services to model the requirements, check the models, and operationalize the models. The applied research methodologies are as follows: design science research paradigm and software case study, model-to-programming (M2P) of business processes, and utilization of patterns of workflow and blockchain.</p>

<p>This article discusses about Project Management and advantages on automation of a project management methodology. In light of Business Process Management(BPM), which operates mainly in reducing interference and losses arising from interfaces between organizations, functional areas and hierarchical levels, we report here the case study carried on a public organization in the state of Ceará, Brazil, aiming to evaluate the feasibility of applying the automation of the project management methodology using BPMS.</p>
