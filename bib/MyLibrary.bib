The availability of digital data opens up new opportunities for innovative audit procedures. Process mining can be used as a novel data analysis technique to support auditors in this context. Process mining algorithms produce process models by analyzing recorded event logs. Contemporary general purpose mining algorithms commonly use the temporal order of recorded events for determining the control flow in mined process models. The presented research shows how data dependencies related to the accounting structure of recorded events can be used as an alternative to the temporal order of events for discovering the control flow. The generated models provide accurate information on the control flow from an accounting perspective and show a lower complexity compared to those generated using timestamp dependencies. The presented research follows a design science research approach and uses three different real world data sets for evaluation purposes.},

  abstract = {[The business value of information technology (IT) has been debated for a number of years. While some authors have attributed large productivity improvements and substantial consumer benefits to IT, others report that IT has not had any bottom line impact on business profitability. This paper focuses on the fact that while productivity, consumer value, and business profitability are related, they are ultimately separate questions. Accordingly, the empirical results on IT value depend heavily on which question is being addressed and what data are being used. Applying methods based on economic theory, we are able to define and examine the relevant hypotheses for each of these three questions, using recent firm-level data on IT spending by 370 large firms. Our findings indicate that IT has increased productivity and created substantial value for consumers. However, we do not find evidence that these benefits have resulted in supranormal business profitability. We conclude that while modeling techniques need to be improved, these results are collectively consistent with economic theory. Thus, there is no inherent contradiction between increased productivity, increased consumer value, and unchanged business profitability.]}

The creation of such models is, however, cumbersome as multiple aspects of an organization need to be considered, making manual efforts time-consuming, and error prone. Thus, the EA approach would be significantly more promising if the data used when creating the models could be collected automatically—a topic not yet properly addressed by either academia or industry. This paper proposes network scanning for automatic data collection and uses an existing software tool for generating EA models (ArchiMate is employed as an example) based on the IT infrastructure of enterprises. While some manual effort is required to make the models fully useful to many practical scenarios (e.g., to detail the actual services provided by IT components), empirical results show that the methodology is accurate and (in its default state) require little effort to carry out.},

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don’t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of “normal science,” as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn’s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking’s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. ~Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of the study is to develop an integrated framework for managing project risks by analyzing risk across project, work package and activity levels, and developing responses. Design/methodology/approach The study first reviews the literature of various contemporary risk management frameworks in order to identify gaps in project risk management knowledge. Then it develops a conceptual risk management framework using combined analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and risk map for managing project risks. The proposed framework has then been applied to a 1500\&\#xa0;km oil pipeline construction project in India in order to demonstrate its effectiveness. The concerned project stakeholders were involved through focus group discussions for applying the proposed risk management framework in the project under study. Findings The combined AHP and risk map approach is very effective to manage project risks across project, work package and activity levels. The risk factors in project level are caused because of external forces such as business environment (e.g. customers, competitors, technological development, politics, socio-economic environment). The risk factors in work package and activity levels are operational in nature and created due to internal causes such as lack of material and labor productivity, implementation issues, team ineffectiveness, etc. Practical implications The suggested model can be applied to any complex project and helps manage risk throughout the project life cycle. Originality/value Both business and operational risks constitute project risks. In one hand, the conventional project risk management frameworks emphasize on managing business risks and often ignore operational risks. On the other hand, the studies that deal with operational risk often do not link them with business risks. However, they need to be addressed in an integrated way as there are a few risks that affect only the specific level. Hence, this study bridges the gaps.},

  abstract = {Project management literature tends to focus on the early phases of a project and on the associated generic project management competences, such as planning, scheduling, budgeting, resourcing and motivating. Only a small fraction of the discussion is devoted to project closure and to the competences needed when a project fails to reach the goals and so needs to be closed prematurely. The purpose of this paper is to develop an understanding of project-ending competences needed in premature project closures. Two cases of premature project closure are analysed in different contexts: in the car industry and the aircraft manufacturing industry. The key findings concern the managerial challenges that are present in premature project closures: the need for involvement of senior and also project managers, the need to understand the often changed role of internal and external project stakeholders, and the need to understand that the ‘future matters’ in premature project closure.},

  abstract = {Summary: By their very nature, construction projects can create seemingly endless opportunities for conflict. Written by a best selling author with over 40 years of experiences in the construction and general contracting business, Construction Process Planning and Management provides you with the necessary tools to save time and money on your construction project. In this book, Sid Levy provides valuable advice for avoiding or working through the common problems that are a result of the long-term nature of construction projects, failure to select a?project delivery system? appropriate to the project, incomplete drawing and specifications, unrealistic scheduling, poor communication and coordination among participants, and inadequate contract administration. From project genesis, through design development to contractor and contract selection, on to construction oversight, punch list and successful project close-out, this book will point out those pitfalls to avoid and offer practical advice at every step along the way. Administer the general construction process including solicitation of contractor's qualifications (pre-qualify bidders), comparative analysis of bid packages, recommendation for contract award, contract document negotiation and documentation of job change orders. Provide Project Planning and on-site management and coordination of all construction projects. Ensure compliance of building construction rules and regulations and collaborate with chief engineers to monitor quality of construction. Conduct technical/plan review of construction documents and submit written responses identifying required corrections or changes.

  abstract = {Summary: The rate of failure of IT projects has remained little changed in survey after survey over the past 15-20 years-over 40-50\%. This has happened in spite of new technology, innovative methods and tools, and different management methods. Why does this happen? Why can't the situation be better? One reason is that many think of each IT effort as unique. In reality many IT projects are very similar at a high, strategic level. Where they differ is in the people and exact events-the detail. If you read the literature or have been in information systems or IT for some time, you have seen the same reasons for failure and the same problems and issues recur again and again. In this book IT Management experts Ben Lientz and Lee Larssen show you how to identify and track the recurring issues leading to failure in IT projects and provide a proven, modern method for addressing them. By following the recommendations in this books readers can significantly reduce the risk of IT failures and increase the rate of success. Benefits of using this approach: .Issues are identified earlier-giving more time for solution and action. .Issues are resolved more consistently since the approach tracks on their repetition. .You get an early warning of problems in IT work-before the budget or schedule fall apart. .Management tends to have more realistic expectations with an awareness of issues. .Users and managers have greater confidence in IT due to the improved handling of issues. .Since the number of issues tends to stabilize in an organization, the IT organization and management get better at detecting, preventing, and dealing with issues over time-cumulative improvement. .Giving attention to issues make users more realistic in their requests and acts to deter requirement changes and scope creep. * Full of checklists and methods that can be used in day to day Project Management work in real companies * Easy to read style and book organization allows the reader to jump into the book right at the point they need * Shows how to set up an issues database for better identification and tracking of issues, providing an Early Warning System to help move the project to success. Summary: The authors "show you how to identify and track the recurring issues leading to failure in IT projects, and [they] provide a proven, modern method for addressing them. By following the recommendations in this book, readers will significanctly reduce the risk of IT failures and increase the rate of success." [Back cover]. Part 1:Issues and Risk Management -- 1.

  abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore a case study example of the decision-making process that occurs within complex organizations. It exposes a murky "zone" of decision making and action between the strategic vision set by senior management and the work of teams to realise projects. Design/methodology/approach - A case study from the experience of one of the authors is used to illustrate the activities in this "zone". The lessons from the case study are supported by emerging project management and general management literature. The paper is exploratory in nature and the case study used provides a useful vehicle for reflection and sensemaking. Findings - The "zone" is metaphorically described as a highly complex and dynamic organism. Operating in the "zone" requires agility and an understanding of both the project and the organizational environment to cope with the demands of its chaotic nature. The paper's conclusions indicate that the traditional command-and-control management style is counter-productive in today's organizations. Research limitations/implications - Key implications include the need for project managers and their teams to be politically astute and sensitive to the needs and pressures of a wide range of project stakeholders. A methodology and tool for visualising the influence of stakeholders can be of considerable use and a flexible style of decision making is necessary to manage within the inherent uncertainty, complexity and chaos found in projects and organizations like the one illustrated by the case study. Originality/value - Shows that a paradigm shift in management thinking is needed to succeed in managing projects and their teams within the turbulent environment of a modern matrix organization.

  abstract = {Over 150 Information Technology practitioners participated in a study of differences in communication risk between traditional project teams and those that operate virtually, with some team members physically remote. Contrary to prior research, results indicate the level of risk from inadequate communication is not significantly greater when team members are not grouped in one location. Further, despite increased dependence of virtual teams on technology for communication, there was no evidence of significantly more project risk due to technological failure. However, virtual team projects exhibited notably more risk due to insufficient knowledge transfer. A plausible explanation is decreased implicit or informal knowledge transfer in virtual environments. We conclude that the possibility of insufficient knowledge transfer should be included in virtual project risk management plans, and consideration should be given in such projects to the extent to which knowledge that is traditionally shared implicitly might be shared explicitly through electronic means.},

  abstract = {Why do some teams consistently deliver high performance while other, seemingly identical teams struggle? Led by Sandy Pentland, researchers at MIT's Human Dynamics Laboratory set out to solve that puzzle. Hoping to decode the "It factor" that made groups click, they equipped teams from a broad variety of projects and industries (comprising 2,500 individuals in total) with wearable electronic sensors that collected data on their social behavior for weeks at a time. With remarkable consistency, the data showed that the most important predictor of a team's success was its communication patterns. Those patterns were as significant as all other factors-intelligence, personality, talent-combined. In fact, the researchers could foretell which teams would outperform simply by looking at the data on their communication, without even meeting their members. In this article Pentland shares the secrets of his findings and shows how anyone can engineer a great team. He has identified three key communication dynamics that affect performance: energy,engagement, and exploration. Drawing from the data, he has precisely quantified the ideal team patterns for each. Even more significant, he has seen that when teams map their own communication behavior over time and then make adjustments that move it closer to the ideal, they can dramatically improve their performance.

Change in the construction industry is inevitable, and it occurs to some degree during almost every construction project. Changes may be minor, such as requesting additional money for the purchase of a valve. Or, changes may be complex, such as requesting millions of dollars for schedule delays and labor productivity losses. This article identifies six steps for the parties involved in a construction project to implement as part of change order management prior to the start of construction, during project execution, and if resolution regarding a change is not reached, through the negotiation process. Following these steps can help ensure that changes are managed efficiently and effectively, which, in turn, can lead to the overall success of a project.

  abstract = {A survey on time performance of different types of construction projects in Saudi Arabia was conducted to determine the causes of delay and their importance according to each of the project participants, i.e., the owner, consultant and the contractor. The field survey conducted included 23 contractors, 19 consultants, and 15 owners. Seventy-three causes of delay were identified during the research. 76\% of the contractors and 56\% of the consultants indicated that average of time overrun is between 10\% and 30\% of the original duration. The most common cause of delay identified by all the three parties is “change order”. Surveys concluded that 70\% of projects experienced time overrun and found that 45 out of 76 projects considered were delayed.},

The specifics of which work to outsource and when matter less than the quality of the three people new projects need which includes a strong, involved sponsor from the business side, an efficient project manager and a skilled technical specialist, says David Hutchison, president of Excipio Consulting, which specializes in cost-justification of technology projects. The first task is to get a technology project approved by business executives by demonstrating its potential payoff and keeping discussion focused on its business goals.  The second, most important, element to a project's success is the project manager, who should have more than just a couple of courses of project management and a reputation for being organized, according to Bob Wourms, director of outsourcing and professional staffing at the consultancy Project Management Solutions.  The third critical element is a skilled lead technologist, who can keep the programming on track and also oversee training for technical staffers who have moved on to the project in search of new challenges and skills.},

  abstract = {Project Risk Registers have been used extensively for many years. However, they do not account for the interaction between risks, for example, the occurrence of one risk exacerbating other risks or portfolios of risks being more significant than the sum of the individual risks. This leads to the need to consider ‘risk systemicity’ as a part of risk analysis. This paper reports on a specific case for a large multinational project based organization, one that the authors had been involved with in the analysis of a number of projects that had massive cost overruns. Following these analyses the organization was persuaded of the importance of risk systemicity. The organization therefore engaged the authors to develop a ‘Risk Filter’. This filter is a tool for identifying areas of risk exposure on future projects and creating a framework for their investigation. The ‘Risk Filter’ is now used on all projects ever since its introduction; by the end of May 2003 it had been used by nine divisions, on over 60 major projects, and completed by 450 respondents. It is also used at several stages during the life of a project to aid in the risk assessment and management of each project, and contributes to a project database.

  abstract = {While seemingly incompatible, combining global software development and agile practices is a challenge undertaken by many companies. Case study reports on the successful use of agile practices in small distributed projects already exist. How these practices can be applied to larger projects, however, remains unstudied. This paper reports a case study on agile practices in a 40-person development organization distributed between Norway and Malaysia. Based on seven interviews in the development organization, we describe how scrum practices were successfully applied, e.g. using teleconferencing and web cameras for daily scrum meetings, synchronized 4-week sprints, weekly scrum-of-scrums, and Jira for backlog management. Non-scrum agile practices included nightly builds, automated testing, and team rooms. Supportig global software development practices, e.g. frequent visits, unofficial distributed meetings, domain expert networks, and annual gatherings are described. Positive experiences of using scrum included improved communication, trust and motivation, as well as better perceived quality. Challenges included misunderstood requirements, lack of videoconferencing possibilities, and awkward communication in distributed meetings due to cultural and geographical distance.

It's being used more and more frequently - and more successfully - on a wide variety of high-profile corporate projects, and has long been used to fund large-scale natural resource projects, from pipelines and refineries to electric-generating facilities and hydroelectric projects. But the challenges of successful project financing are immense, and the requirements of the process can easily be misunderstood." "This newly updated edition of Project Financing takes you through the process step by step. Using actual examples and case studies - including Euro Disneyland and the Eurotunnel Project - that illustrate how to apply the analytical techniques described in the book, it covers the rationale for project financing, how to prepare the financial plan, assess the risks, design the financing mix, and raise the funds."--Jacket.},

  abstract = {A lean-agile model of homebuilders' production systems is proposed in this research. Value stream mapping is utilized to clarify the proposed lean-agile model, in which pull and Kanban are used to ensure smooth production upstream of the de-coupling point, while fluctuating market demands in terms of variety of homes and variability of volumes are managed by the agile process downstream of the de-coupling point. The de-coupling point is used to provide components to downstream agile process and shield upstream smooth production from market fluctuations. A simulation model is developed to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed lean-agile model. Simulation experiments show that the lean-agile model prevents the accumulation of high inventory levels and thus provides better customization opportunities for clients compared to even-flow-construction. It also provides a more stable process with shorter cycle times compared to sales-driven production. The proposed lean-agile model offers new possibilities for homebuilders to manage the balance between meeting fluctuating market demands and stabilizing the production system.

  abstract = {Abstract Several international studies have perceived the UK construction industry as less productive than those of the other progressive nations. Moreover, many UK construction clients have expressed dissatisfaction regarding the delivery of the completed projects, the quality of service and the predictability of cost. In order to address these problems, client-led innovation in construction projects has been emphasized by Sir Michael Latham's report Constructing the Team . The quality of the service that the client receives depends partly on the client's own involvement in the project. This will require the client to take a positive approach to promoting continuous improvement to all work situations. The traditional role of the client's representative varies from one of simply designing to the full monitoring of the project. It may also include project management activities such as planning, scheduling, coordinating and motivating. In total quality management (TQM) the administrative tasks of the client's representative include many aspects already addressed under traditional arrangements. However, current literature suggests that confusion exists over the involvement and participation of the client's representative when TQM is adopted in construction projects. To address this problem, research was conducted to identify the critical tasks for the client's representative to achieve total quality in construction. The findings also developed relevant best practices to be performed by the client's representative. This paper concentrates on the tasks of the client's representative, and assesses their importance in terms of improving quality in construction.

  abstract = {Developing teams capable of completing projects in extreme situations is becoming a major challenge for a growing number of organizations. The notion of collective competence is increasingly being seen as a vital precondition for the success of project teams, particularly in extreme environments. However, we still know little about the ingredients of this collective competence. To partially fill this gap, we make use of the insights offered by the very particular world of the French Special Forces, which have been operating successfully for several decades in extreme environments. Based on an in-depth qualitative study of their project-based mode of operations, we detail the six main ingredients of the collective competence that underpins the activities of commando units in the field and insist upon the criticality of the pre- and postmission phases during which this collective competence is actively reinforced.

  abstract = {Models and frameworks used for managing construction projects are typically inspired in business 'cultures' that prevail within industrial contexts. The conceptual backgrounds of quality, performance, and risk environments are explored to ascertain whether these 'cultures' can complement each other. A new general approach towards Risk-Managed Performance-Based Building (RM-PBB) is presented, including the principles and inputs used for designing and implementing an RM-PBB framework. Such a framework envisages the fulfilment of end-users' (society and individuals) and other interested parties' requirements relating to the building product, as well as the agile interaction between and within the building, manufacturing, property, and capital and insurance markets, at both national and international levels. Les modeles et les cadres utilises pour gerer les projets de construction trouvent habituellement leur inspiration dans les « cultures » d'entreprise qui prevalent dans les contextes industriels. Les arriere-plans conceptuels en matiere de qualite, de performance et de milieux a risques sont examines afin d'etablir si ces « cultures » peuvent etre complementaires les unes des autres. Il est presente une nouvelle approche generale visant a une Construction Performancielle a Risques Maitrises, incluant les principes et les apports utilises pour l'elaboration et la mise en œuvre d'un cadre de reference performanciel dans le batiment. Un tel cadre permet d'envisager la satisfaction des exigences des utilisateurs finaux (societe et individus) comme des autres parties interessees par rapport a ce produit qu'est le batiment, ainsi qu'une souplesse d'interaction entre et au sein des marches du batiment, de la production, de l'immobilier, des capitaux et des assurances, aussi bien au niveau national qu'au niveau international.

This figure for cost overrun is referred to frequently by scientific researchers, software process improvement consultants, and government advisors. In this paper, we review the validity of the Standish Group's 1994 cost overrun results. Our review is based on a comparison of the 189\% cost overrun figure with the cost overrun figures reported in other cost estimation surveys, and an examination of the Standish Group's survey design and analysis methods. We find that the figure reported by the Standish Group is much higher than those reported in similar estimation surveys and that there may be severe problems with the survey design and methods of analysis, e.g. the population sampling method may be strongly biased towards ‘failure projects’. We conclude that the figure of 189\% for cost overruns is probably much too high to represent typical software projects in the 1990s and that a continued use of that figure as a reference point for estimation accuracy may lead to poor decision making and hinder progress in estimation practices.},

  abstract = {With the increasing number and complexity of legal obligations, ensuring business process compliance presents a major challenge for today's organizations. In this regard, implementing a set of control means and regularly auditing their effectiveness are suitable measures to ensure a compliant design and enactment of a business process. However, common business process modeling languages (PML) do not provide appropriate concepts to comprehensively model such control means. Not surprisingly, common PMLs are not widely used in the audit domain. To address this gap, this paper presents an extension of a PML with modeling concepts for process-integrated control means. As it is based on previous empirical research with auditors, the extension especially considers their requirements. The results of a laboratory experiment with 78 participants demonstrate that the extension supports auditors to gain a more comprehensive understanding of internal controls in a process model compared to current audit practice.},

  abstract = {Context Large organizations often run hundreds or even thousands of different business processes. Managing such large collections of business process models is a challenging task. Software can assist in performing that task, by supporting common management functions such as storage, search and version management of models. It can also provide advanced functions that are specific for managing collections of process models, such as managing the consistency of public and private processes. Software that supports the management of large collections of business process models is called: business process model repository software. Objective This paper contributes to the development of business process model repositories, by analyzing the state of the art. Method To perform the analysis a literature survey and a comparison of existing (business process model) repository technology is performed. Result The results of the state of the art analysis are twofold. First, a framework for business process model repositories is presented, which consists of a management model and a reference architecture. The management model lists the functionality that can be provided and the reference architecture presents the components that provide that functionality. Second, an analysis is presented of the extent to which existing business process model repositories implement the functionality from the framework. Conclusion The results presented in the paper are valuable as a comprehensive overview of business process model repository functionality. In addition they form a basis for a future research agenda. We conclude that existing repositories focus on traditional functionality rather than exploiting the full potential of information management tools, thus we show that there is a strong basis for further research.},

Further, different research opportunities are identified in this context.},

  abstract = {Purpose  – The purpose of this paper is to foster a common understanding of business process management (BPM) by proposing a set of ten principles that characterize BPM as a research domain and guide its successful use in organizational practice.  Design/methodology/approach  – The identification and discussion of the principles reflects the viewpoint, which was informed by extant literature and focus groups, including 20 BPM experts from academia and practice.  Findings  – The authors identify ten principles which represent a set of capabilities essential for mastering contemporary and future challenges in BPM. Their antonyms signify potential roadblocks and bad practices in BPM. The authors also identify a set of open research questions that can guide future BPM research.  Research limitations/implications  – The findings suggest several areas of research regarding each of the identified principles of good BPM. Also, the principles themselves should be systematically and empirically examined in future studies.  Practical implications  – The findings allow practitioners to comprehensively scope their BPM initiatives and provide a general guidance for BPM implementation. Moreover, the principles may also serve to tackle contemporary issues in other management areas.  Originality/value  – This is the first paper that distills principles of BPM in the sense of both good and bad practice recommendations. The value of the principles lies in providing normative advice to practitioners as well as in identifying open research areas for academia, thereby extending the reach and richness of BPM beyond its traditional frontiers.},

First, a non-customized process view is constructed from an internal structured process model by aggregating internal activities the provider wishes to hide. Second, a customized process view is constructed by hiding and omitting activities from the non-customized view that are not requested by the process consumer. The feasibility of the approach is shown by means of a case study.},

While the identification of critical success factors for the management of business process related projects has been addressed by some research projects, the risks associated with these projects have received considerably less attention. This is a concern: Although BPM projects contain phases that relate to traditional software development and deployment projects, the application of risk mitigation strategies found in software engineering ignores the subsequent process management phases that follow upon the implementation and automation of processes. This paper provides an overview of risks associated with BPM projects along the phases of the BPM lifecycle. After a classification of the risks identified with individual lifecycle phases and transitions we discuss four strategies to deal with these risks: avoidance, mitigation, transfer, and acceptance. The outlook of this paper discusses how assessment frameworks such as CobIT and COSO can be applied to risk management in the context of BPM.},

As organizations become more complex and dynamic, individuals’ ability to learn from experience becomes more important. Recently, the concept of learning agility has attracted considerable attention from human resource professionals and consultants interested in selecting on and developing employees’ ability to learn from experience. However, the academic community has been largely absent from this discussion of learning agility, and the concept remains ill defined and poorly measured. This article presents a constructive critique of the existing literature on learning agility, seeks to clarify the definition and conceptualization of the construct, and situates learning agility within a broader nomological network of related constructs. We conclude by discussing several important directions for future research on learning agility.

\par
This report examines the relevance gap in management research. Its focus is the nature of knowledge created by research at the interface between business and academia in the context of major changes likely to affect the nature of demand for such knowledge. Management research has been accused of a lack of relevance to managerial practice and of too narrow a discipline base. The report examines the conditions giving rise to this criticism, in the UK and elsewhere, and identifies an important strategic need to increase the stakeholding of users in various aspects of the research and knowledge creation and dissemination process. The report concludes with recommendations concerning new forms of research partnership and research training that will address the relevance gap. However, bridging this gap does not only require changes in the academic mind-set. Managers and firms too need to rethink their involvement in the research process.

Karl E. Weick (Karl Edward Weick is an American organizational theorist who introduced the concepts of "loose coupling", "mindfulness", and "sensemaking" into organizational studies. He is the Rensis Likert Distinguished University Professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.)
\par
The much lamented ‘relevance gap’ is as much a product of practitioners wedded to gurus and fads as it is of academics wedded to abstractions and fundamentals. The gap persists because practitioners forget that ‘the’ real world is actually ‘a’ world that is idiosyncratic, egocentric and unique to each person complaining about relevance. Greater attention to the conceptual underpinnings of fads and egocentric perception suggest the existence of more fundamental barriers to effectiveness such as ceilings on improvement, weak situations, ambiguous signals, non-obvious adaptive forms and preoccupation with vision. Joint practitioner-academic effort devoted to questions of how events come to be seen as ‘real’ could re-bridge a gap whose nature has been misidentified.

  note = {\subsection{Summary}

\par
We examine three related ways in which the gap between theory and practice has been framed. One approach views it as a knowledge transfer problem, a second argues that theory and practice represent distinct kinds of knowledge, and a third incorporates a strategy of arbitrage—leading to the view that the gap is a knowledge production problem. We propose a method of engaged scholarship for addressing the knowledge production problem, arguing that engaged scholarship not only enhances the relevance of research for practice but also contributes significantly to advancing research knowledge in a given domain.

\par
With more and more academics feeling more and more pressure to produce numbers of publications, I articulate the value of papers that are perhaps fewer in number, but have more impact on the subsequent research and thinking of others. Based on a presentation at a 2011 Academy of Management Professional Development Workshop entitled, “What Is an Academic Home Run and How Do I Hit One?,” this paper describes the attributes of “home run” papers in our field using four exemplars. From this analysis, I distill their lessons for all of us about the nature of both the ideas presented and the processes involved in creating articles with scholarly impact.

\textbf{Abstract}
\par
In this paper we describe a five-stage phenomenological model of skill acquisition, of which expertise is the highest stage. Contrary to the claims of knowledge engineers, we argue that expertise in general, and medical expertise in particular, cannot be captured in rule-based expert systems, since expertise is based on the making of immediate, unreflective situational responses; intuitive judgment is the hallmark of expertise. Deliberation is certainly used by experts, if time permits, but it is done for the purpose of improving intuition, not replacing it. The best way to avoid mistakes is to take responsibility for them when they occur, rather than try to prevent them by foolproof rules. In bureaucratic societies, however, there is the danger that expertise may be diminished through over-reliance on calculative rationality.

How work gets done has changed fundamentally in recent decades, with a growing number of people working independently, outside of organizations in a style of work quite different from that assumed by many organizational behavior theories. To remain relevant, our research on individual work behaviors and the capabilities that enable them must also adapt to this new world of work, the so-called “gig economy.” We first describe the predictable challenges that individuals confront when working in this manner, including remaining viable, staying organized, maintaining identity, sustaining relationships, and coping emotionally. We then articulate a research agenda that pushes our field to focus on the specific capabilities and behaviors that enable people to manage these challenges effectively so as to survive or thrive in this new world of work. Foregrounding individual agency, we articulate the work and relational behaviors necessary for such thriving, and the cognitive and emotional capabilities that undergird them.},

We conceptualize organizational teams as dynamic systems evolving in response to their environments. We then review the past 10 years of team effectiveness research and summarize its implications by categorizing studies under three main overlapping and coevolving dimensions: compositional features, structural features, and mediating mechanisms. We highlight prominent work that focused on variables in each of these dimensions and discuss their key relationships with team outcomes. Furthermore, we review how contextual factors impact team effectiveness. On the basis of this review, we advocate that future research seek to examine team relationships through a dynamic, multilevel perspective, while incorporating new and novel measurement techniques. We submit that the future of teams research may benefit from a conceptualization of them as dynamic networks and modeling them as small complex systems.},

  abstract = {Companies are increasingly embedded in B2B environments, where they have to collaborate in order to achieve their goals. Such collaborations lead to inter-organizational business processes that may be commonly supported through the exchange of electronic data interchange (EDI) messages (e.g., electronic purchase orders, invoices etc.). Despite the appearance of XML, traditional approaches to EDI, such as EDIFACT and ANSI X.12, still play an overwhelmingly dominant role. However, such traditional EDI standards lack a notion of process. In other words, the exchanged business documents are typically not embedded in the context of other exchanged business documents. This has two shortcomings: (1) the inability to apply proven business process management (BPM) methods, including process mining techniques, in such settings; and (2) the unavailability of systematic approaches to business intelligence (BI) using information from exchanged EDI messages. In this article, we present the EDImine Framework for enabling (1) the application of process mining techniques in the field of EDI-supported inter-organizational business processes, and (2) for supporting inter-organizational performance evaluation using business information from EDI messages, event logs and process models. As an enabling technology, we present a method for the semantic preprocessing of EDIFACT messages to exploit this potentially rich source of information by applying state of the art BPM and BI techniques. We show the applicability of our approach by means of a case study based on real-world EDI data of a German consumer goods manufacturing company.},

On the other hand, there is a need to improve and support business processes in competitive and rapidly changing environments. This manifesto is created by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining and aims to promote the topic of process mining. Moreover, by defining a set of guiding principles and listing important challenges, this manifesto hopes to serve as a guide for software developers, scientists, consultants, business managers, and end-users.

We provide details of some of our initial findings of the REA/TOA analysis which we carried out on the SAP Human Capital Management (HCM) module. Given that SAP is recognized as the dominant ERP system with over 50\% of the market share, this technology is viewed as the representative case study technology for exploring the theory of REA in actual ERP systems. In particular O’Leary’s and Dunn et al.’s works are expanded upon, substantiating O’Leary’s findings that SAP was found to be consistent with REA in its database, semantic and structure orientations. Using SAP’s HCM module as the exemplar, two notable discoveries are made. These are namely (i) identifying that several anomalies exist in the underlying data model, and (ii) that there are many more REA entities than previously discovered by Dunn et al. Through the SAP HCM exemplar it is shown that REA adds value to modelling business processes in ERP systems.},

Although Process Mining has been applied experimentally on micro-level workflow processes, it is not so easy to apply on the level of the value cycle that is at the core of accounting databases. A more general problem is that the new smart approaches lack a well-developed accounting ontology. The REA business ontology does offer such an ontology but so far, its main focus has been on accounting database design. In this paper, a Petri Net specification of REA is proposed for ontologybased process analysis. This specification makes it possible to express more than the traditional static specification. The paper also describes how REA Petri Nets can be developed using Process Mining and how they can be applied in a Continuous Auditing framework.},

We consider problems in which multiple interacting process perspectives — in particular control-flow, data, resources, time, and functions — are considered together. The contributed methods span several types of process mining: two are concerned with conformance checking, two are process discovery techniques, and one is a decision mining method. All methods have been implemented, evaluated, and applied in the context of four case studies.},

  abstract = {Since their inception in 1962, Petri nets have been used in a wide variety of application domains. Although Petri nets are graphical and easy to understand, they have formal semantics and allow for analysis techniques ranging from model checking and structural analysis to process mining and performance analysis. Over time Petri nets emerged as a solid foundation for Business Process Management (BPM) research. The BPM discipline develops methods, techniques, and tools to support the design, enactment, management, and analysis of operational business processes. Mainstream business process modeling notations and workflow management systems are using token-based semantics borrowed from Petri nets. Moreover, state-of-the-art BPM analysis techniques are using Petri nets as an internal representation. Users of BPM methods and tools are often not aware of this. This paper aims to unveil the seminal role of Petri nets in BPM.},

Business process models are used to describe detailed enterprise processes in order to analyse and improve them.

Therefore EA models and business process models must be linked to address in detail both structural and behavioural aspects of the information system. However linked EA and business process models do not imply that the models provide complete and lawful descriptions of the information system.

  abstract = {Accountants have modeled and documented accounting information systems (AIS) through system flowcharts, which have also been used to study internal controls. However, when AIS are large, complex, and distributed, their system flowcharts are difficult to comprehend, challenging to use, and insufficient to support decision making in system design and implementation. In this primer we propose a set of requirements for modeling and documenting complex AIS that address those concerns. Since most other models such as SSAD, UML, and BPMN used to represent AIS are influenced by or can be reduced to Petri net models, we compare system flowcharts with Petri net representation of AIS. We evaluate systems flowcharts and Petri nets for their suitability in modeling AIS. We find that Petri nets are an attractive alternative due to their extensive capability to perform analytics and simulation. Analytics can be used to study structural and behavioral properties while simulations can help study run-time behavior of systems to evaluate computing capacity and system performance. We provide a detailed description and guidelines of how design analytics and implementation analytics can be achieved based on the Petri net framework. With this unified modeling strategy, we also describe how it can support the process of audit analytics. Petri nets are popular in computer science, engineering, manufacturing, supply chain management, and business process reengineering. We explore this viable method for rigorous study of AIS modeling and documentation.},

To achieve this we will take a stepwise approach: identify the key concepts as used in different methods, map their constructs, derive transformations, create their syntax and semantics, and develop requirements specifications on which a tool can be based. For Conceptual modeling we use Object-role modeling (ORM), a fact-oriented approach for modeling information at a conceptual level. For process modeling we use a technique (workflow language) called Yet Another Workflow Language (YAWL). YAWL works as an extension of Petri Nets with constructs to address the multiple instances, advanced synchronization and cancellation patterns.

Researchers have used various maturity models to investigate the development of a business process orientation (BPO), and most have argued that such development comes in stages. Current literature underestimates the interrelationships between BPO capabilities and fails to consider multidimensional or non-linear paths to maturity. To refine the features of maturity models, we rely on configuration theory to uncover different archetypes for BPO development and quantitatively evaluate them by examining performance differences among archetypes based on a large-scale international dataset. The resulting empirical taxonomy with seven BPO archetypes establishes important performance differences between organizations at a similar maturity level. Besides strengthening the theoretical foundations of BPO and making maturity assessments more multifaceted, our results help organizations focus their managerial efforts by enabling comparison with peers in the same archetype and showing various paths for BPO improvement.},

A systematic literature review was carried out following a search for and selection of articles that met our objective. To classify the sampled papers, we followed validated frameworks regarding social media management and business process management. Additionally, a detailed look at the sampled case studies was done to highlight companies’ experiences in the field. Our final sample comprised 47 papers that simultaneously encompassed social media and business process management. The papers were classified according to their publishing frequency, the article type, both the topics and sectors to which they belonged, their methodological approaches, and the importance for business process management capability areas as well as capability subareas. Finally, word frequency queries were used to better understand diverse social media applications in business processes and to derive practical recommendations. The necessity for a multidisciplinary approach toward business processes was detected; therefore, topics, such as psychology, business economics, or information systems, were included, emphasizing innovation strategies, including gamification, big data, or crowdsourcing. Our most important recommendation concerns the evolution of business process management through different social media tools as a means to achieve a transition toward the recommended omnichannel management approach.},

BPMN offers a wide range of modeling constructs, significantly more than other popular languages. However, not all of these constructs are equally important in practice as business analysts frequently use arbitrary subsets of BPMN. In this paper we investigate what these subsets are, and how they differ between academic, consulting, and general use of the language. We analyzed 120 BPMN diagrams using mathematical and statistical techniques. Our findings indicate that BPMN is used in groups of several, well-defined construct clusters, but less than 20\% of its vocabulary is regularly used and some constructs did not occur in any of the models we analyzed. While the average model contains just 9 different BPMN constructs, models of this complexity have typically just 4-5 constructs in common, which means that only a small agreed subset of BPMN has emerged. Our findings have implications for the entire ecosystems of analysts and modelers in that they provide guidance on how to reduce language complexity, which should increase the ease and speed of process modeling.},

  abstract = {The world is blazing with change and digital innovation is fuelling the fire. Process management can help channel the heat into useful work. Unfortunately, research on digital innovation and process management has been conducted by separate communities operating under orthogonal assumptions. We argue that a synthesis of assumptions is required to bring these streams of research together. We offer suggestions for how these assumptions can be updated to facilitate a convergent conversation between the two research streams. We also suggest ways that methodologies from each stream could benefit the other. Together with the three exemplar empirical studies included in the special issue on business process management and digital innovation, we develop a broader foundation for reinventing research on business process management in a world ablaze with digital innovation.},

  abstract = {This paper is aimed at examining the role of annual reports’ sentiment in forecasting financial performance. The sentiment (tone, opinion) is assessed using several categorization schemes in order to explore various aspects of language used in the annual reports of U.S. companies. Further, we employ machine learning methods and neural networks to predict financial performance expressed in terms of theZ-score bankruptcy model. Eleven categories of sentiment (ranging from negative and positive to active and common) are used as the inputs of the prediction models. Support vector machines provide the highest forecasting accuracy. This evidence suggests that there exist non-linear relationships between the sentiment and financial performance. The results indicate that the sentiment information is an important forecasting determinant of financial performance and, thus, can be used to support decision-making process of corporate stakeholders.

  abstract = {In recent years, monitoring the compliance of business processes with relevant regula- tions, constraints, and rules during runtime has evolved as major concern in literature and practice. Monitoring not only refers to continuously observing possible compliance violations, but also includes the ability to provide fine-grained feedback and to predict possible compliance violations in the future. The body of literature on business process compliance is large and approaches specifically addressing process monitoring are hard to identify. Moreover, proper means for the systematic comparison of these approaches are missing. Hence, it is unclear which approaches are suitable for particular scenarios. The goal of this paper is to define a framework for Compliance Monitoring Functionalities (CMF) that enables the systematic comparison of existing and new approaches for monitoring compliance rules over business processes during runtime. To define the scope of the framework, at first, related areas are identified and discussed. The CMFs are harvested based on a systematic literature review and five selected case studies. The appropriateness of the selection of CMFs is demonstrated in two ways: (a) a systematic comparison with pattern-based compliance approaches and (b) a classification of existing compliance monitoring approaches using the CMFs. Moreover, the application of the CMFs is showcased using three existing tools that are applied to two realistic data sets. Overall, the CMF framework provides powerful means to position existing and future compliance monitoring approaches.},

  abstract = {The “expectations gap” refers to differences in views of auditors and users regarding the extent of assurance obtained from auditing procedures. One aspect of the expectations gap considered by prior research is whether users differentiate the level of assurance provided by different audit procedures. We extend that research by studying whether investors understand that information outside of the financial statements, in the 10-K as well as on corporate websites, is not audited. This research is important, as the Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board currently is considering proposals aimed at clarifying or expanding the auditor's responsibility for that information. We surveyed professional and nonprofessional investors, and find that professionals are more likely than nonprofessionals to correctly identify which 10-K components are audited. However, many investors in both groups believe that information outside of the financial statements is audited when in fact it is not. We also find some evidence that investors use certain information categories more often when they believe that the information is audited. Also, for both investor groups, responses concerning whether currently unaudited information categories should be audited suggest an unmet demand for greater assurance on information outside of the financial statements. Our results support proposals for greater clarity in the audit opinion concerning the nature of procedures performed on information outside of the financial statements. Further, our findings imply that additional assurance on that information might be considered useful.},

A large number of data integration tools exist, but they generally can only work on relational data. Existing systems for extracting relational data from spreadsheets are too labor intensive to support ad-hoc integration tasks, in which the correct extraction target is only learned during the course of user interaction.This paper introduces a system that automatically extracts relational data from spreadsheets, thereby enabling relational spreadsheet integration. The resulting integrated relational data can be queried directly or can be translated into RDF triples. When compared to standard techniques for spreadsheet data extraction on a set of 100 random Web spreadsheets, the system reduces the amount of human labor by 72\% to 92\%. In addition to the system design, we present the results of a general survey of more than 400,000 spreadsheets we downloaded from the Web, giving a novel view of how users organize their data in spreadsheets.},

The purpose of this paper is to build a rigorous, integrated, and up-to-date definition of the Open Science phenomenon through a systematic literature review. The resulting definition “Open Science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks” helps the scientific community, the business world, political actors, and citizens to have a common and clear understanding about what Open Science is, and stimulates an open debate about the social, economic, and human added value of this phenomenon.},

Although the two countries exhibit some similarities, there are important differences in legal systems, capital markets, and corporate governance mechanisms. The disclosure model developed is based on the main headings specified in the Fourth and Seventh European Union Directives. Based on this model, disclosure by U.K. companies is more comprehensive than by Dutch corporations and the difference is significant (5 percent level with two-tailed test). Most of the key areas of disclosure are found to be more comprehensive in the U.K. than in The Netherlands. This is due to more stringent regulation in the U.K. than in The Netherlands where the approach is more flexible. The model is used to establish whether disclosure is related to a number of firm-specific characteristics using regression analysis. The impact of size is the same for both countries, but other firm-specific characteristics have different effects.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Many researchers and practitioners suggest a contingent instead of a “one size fits all” approach in business process management (BPM). The purpose of this paper is to offer a contingency theory of BPM, which proposes contingency factors relevant to the successful management of business processes and that explains how and why these contingencies impact the relationships between process management and performance.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The authors develop the theory by drawing on organizational information processing theory (OIPT) and applying an information processing (IP) perspective to the process level.                                         Findings               The premise of the model is that the process management mechanisms such as documentation, standardization or monitoring must compensate for the uncertainty and equivocality of the nature of the process that has to be managed. In turn, managing through successful adaptation is a prerequisite for process performance.                                         Research limitations/implications               The theory provides a set of testable propositions that specify the relationship between process management mechanisms and process performance. The authors also discuss implications of the new theory for further theorizing and outline empirical research strategies that can be followed to enact, evaluate and extend the theory.                                         Practical implications               The theory developed in this paper allows an alternative way to describe organizational processes and supports the derivation of context-sensitive management approaches for process documentation, standardization, monitoring, execution and coordination.                                         Originality/value               The theoretical model is novel in that it provides a contextualized view on BPM that acknowledges different types of processes and suggests different mechanisms for managing these. The authors hope the paper serves as inspiration both for further theory development as well as to empirical studies that test, refute, support or otherwise augment the arguments.},

  abstract = {Regulations provide the legal basis for good manufacturing practices in the food industry. They define a common terminology and the requirements for improving food quality and safety, which are highly important in light of past and current food scandals. However, the rules that can be derived from regulations are scattered in legal texts that have to be processed manually to create a set of company-specific process controls. Current approaches lack an intermediate, domain-specific representation that fosters reuse and is technology-agnostic. In this paper, such a pattern-based approach is developed to formalize compliance requirements in the food industry. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it presents a pattern catalogue that is built on the basis of real-world legal documents. Second, it devises a transformation process that allows users to systematically capture compliance requirements from textual descriptions, to represent them in the form of patterns and, finally, to transform them into executable process controls.},

This paper surveys research on textual analysis of corporate disclosures, such as financial statements, earnings releases, and conference call transcripts. Specifically, the author focuses on research related to earnings quality, stock market efficiency, and corporate financial policies using the textual information in corporate disclosures. In this survey, he focuses on empirical large-sample textual analysis studies built upon the latest development in computational linguistics, natural language processing, and statistics. However, several challenges exist for researchers who want to advance this literature. First, much of the existing research has a strong methodology flavor. Second, like many other empirical studies in the accounting literature, the large-sample textual analysis literature also raises concerns about endogeneity. Third, for some studies especially for studies that attempt to measure managerial characteristics using the corporate filings, there could be some concerns about who actually writes the corporate disclosures.},

  note = {Net Promotor Score (NPS) is a simple yet prominent indicator for customer satisfaction that is widely used in organizations. An in-depth analysis of the NPS and its drivers can provide organizations with highly valuable insights into their current deficiencies and strengths. CFO’s, for example, can use this metric to develop a strategy map. This case study explores the use of machine learning to perform an NPS key driver analysis at IndyCare, an Indian hospital group. The aim is to develop a model that predicts whether patients are promotors, detractors or passive customers for the hospital, and to assess feature importance of the models. The participants will also learn how to address a specific problem encountered when using NPS status as a target variable. In particular, the difference in scaling between the features and the target variable causes a low statistical fit of the various models. This problem is addressed by adding an additional feature to the model which considers subgroups of patients with common scoring patterns. Next to the analysis on the level of the hospital group, the participants will also go more into detail in this case study. More specifically, they will examine whether different patient groups have other drivers for their NPS. For this purpose, the participants will also explore unsupervised learning by making use of clustering techniques.},

Common BPMLs such as BPMN 2.0 or EPC are widely accepted and applied in various domains. However, such BPMLs provide a set of generic process modeling elements but do not allow for modeling domain specific concepts. This also holds true for control means as one of the key concepts for process audits. To address this gap, this paper presents an empirically grounded extension of the EPC with modeling concepts for process-integrated control means. The results of a laboratory experiment with 58 participants demonstrate that the extension facilitates a comprehensive enactment of process audits. In conclusion, the results of this research project are contrasted with a previously designed BPMN 2.0 extension in order to present insights we gain from extending two different BPMLs with the same domain concept.},

Organization theory generally takes organizations (business corporations, nonprofits, hospitals, universities, etc.) as discrete and meaningful units of analysis. The revolution in information and communication technologies (ICTs) over the past two decades has made comprehensive time-series data on millions of organizations widely available to scholars around the world. Yet, it is not obvious that organization theory has become more precise, more general, or more accurate as a result. The author argues that this is due to three difficulties that additional data cannot fully resolve: (a) researchers lack experimental control, limiting their ability to draw causal inferences, and are largely inattentive to the standards for valid quasi-experimental design; (b) organizations are more appropriately construed as tools rather than as natural objects susceptible to ‘‘laws;’’ and (c) the regularities underlying organizational dynamics change over time such that empirical generalizations that are true during one period may be false in a different period. I conclude by suggesting improvements to research practice that would enable organization theory to progress toward greater insights.},

  abstract = {What is here called controlled natural language (CNL) has traditionally been given many different names. Especially during the last four decades, a wide variety of such languages have been designed. They are applied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations. Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.},

  abstract = {The real estate sector is often presented as an exemplary field that benefits from practical blockchain applications. The general hypothesis is that, in theory, blockchain could solve some significant challenges the real estate sector is facing, such as nontransparency, inefficiencies, fraud and corruption, high costs, and trust issues. However, the literature focuses on blockchain’s theoretical benefits, challenges, or concepts. This research aims to understand the recent developments in the blockchain literature, specifically in the real estate sector, and to understand the current real-world applications by collecting empirical evidence from blockchain studies. The systematic literature review identified 262 relevant documents, after which a thematic content analysis was performed. Conceptual blockchain literature was identified to propose blockchain benefits for the real estate sector in four categories: land administration, real estate transactions, tokenization, and real estate management. The thematic content analysis also identified 26 empirical applications, of which all except one were related to land administration. Although the conceptual and theoretical blockchain literature presents blockchain as a disruptive and transformative technology for the real estate sector, the empirical applications suggest that blockchain adoption materializes more in hybrid, smaller-scale settings, where blockchain is merely an add-on layer to existing systems. Overall, most of the conceptual blockchain benefits remain empirically unconfirmed. On the other hand, the empirical applications suggest that blockchain could, for example, increase efficiency, reduce time, and provide verifiability, transparency, and automation, even in smaller-scale, hybrid settings. In addition, the applications indicate that blockchain could, in some cases, help reduce fraud and increase security and trust compared with centralized digital solutions. Finally, the empirical insights emphasize the role of political will, regulatory framework, availability of reliable digital data, public–private partnerships, and educational aspects in blockchain applications.},

XBRL is an open standard for reporting structured financial information which enables the efficient gathering of data and automated comparison of financial information. To encourage research using XBRL we describe the richness of XBRL data and sources from which it can be obtained. We follow with a review of the literature, beginning with research examining the adoption and use of XBRL by capital market participants. Next, we discuss data quality concerns that may impact the use of XBRL data, followed by a discussion of how auditors use XBRL data and their potential role in the assurance of the data. We then present literature that uses meta and underlying XBRL data to examine financial statement characteristics and disclosure properties. Based on the review of the literature, we identify topics with the greatest potential for future research.}

  abstract = {Business process models are an important means to design, analyze, implement, and control business processes. As with every type of conceptual model, a business process model has to meet certain syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic quality requirements to be of value. For many years, such quality aspects were investigated by centering on the properties of the model artifact itself. Only recently, the process of model creation is considered as a factor that influences the resulting model’s quality. Our work contributes to this stream of research and presents an explorative analysis of the process of process modeling (PPM). We report on two large-scale modeling sessions involving 115 students. In these sessions, the act of model creation, i.e., the PPM, was automatically recorded. We conducted a cluster analysis on this data and identified three distinct styles of modeling. Further, we investigated how both task- and modeler-specific factors influence particular aspects of those modeling styles. Based thereupon, we propose a model that captures our insights. It lays the foundations for future research that may unveil how high-quality process models can be established through better modeling support and modeling instruction.},

Moreover, new challenges have emerged, not just in terms of size (“Big Data”) but also in terms of the questions to be answered. This book focuses on the analysis of behavior based on event data. Process mining techniques use event data to discover processes, check compliance, analyze bottlenecks, compare process variants, and suggest improvements. In later chapters, we will show that process mining provides powerful tools for today’s data scientist.

The goal is to find commonalities and discrepancies between the modeled behavior and the observed behavior. Conformance checking is relevant for business alignment and auditing. For example, the event log can be replayed on top of the process model to find undesirable deviations suggesting fraud or inefficiencies. Moreover, conformance checking techniques can also be used for measuring the performance of process discovery algorithms and to repair models that are not aligned well with reality.},

Today, however, many data sources are updated in (near) real-time and sufficient computing power is available to analyze events when they occur. Therefore, process mining should not be restricted to off-line analysis and can also be used for online operational support. This chapter broadens the scope of process mining to include online decision support. For example, for a running case the remaining flow time can be predicted and suitable actions can be recommended to minimize costs.},

  abstract = {Process mining is impossible without proper event logs. This chapter describes the information that should be present in such event logs. Depending on the process mining technique used, these requirements may vary. The challenge is to extract such data from a variety of data sources, e.g., databases, flat files, message logs, transaction logs, ERP systems, and document management systems. When merging and extracting data, both syntax and semantics play an important role. Moreover, depending on the questions one seeks to answer, different views on the available data are needed. Process mining, like any other data-driven analysis approach, needs to deal with data quality problems. We discuss typical data quality challenges encountered in reality. The insights provided in this chapter help to get the event data assumed to be present in later chapters.},

  abstract = {The successful application of process mining relies on good tool support. Traditional Business Intelligence (BI) tools are data-centric and focus on rather simplistic forms of analysis. Mainstream data mining and machine learning tools provide more sophisticated forms of analysis, but are also not tailored towards the analysis and improvement of processes. Fortunately, there are dedicated process mining tools able to transform event data into actionable process-related insights. For example, ProM is an open-source process mining tool supporting all of the techniques mentioned in this book. Process discovery, conformance checking, social network analysis, organizational mining, clustering, decision mining, prediction, and recommendation are all supported by ProM plug-ins. However, the usability of the hundreds of available plug-ins varies and the complexity of the tool may be overwhelming for end-users. In recent years, several vendors released dedicated process mining tools (e.g., Celonis, Disco, EDS, Fujitsu, Minit, myInvenio, Perceptive, PPM, QPR, Rialto, and SNP). These tools typically provide less functionality than ProM, but are easier to use while focusing on data extraction, performance analysis and scalability. This chapter provides an overview of available tools and trends.},

On the other hand, ideas originating from the data mining field will be used for the evaluation of process mining results. For example, one can adopt various data mining approaches to measure the quality of the discovered or enhanced process models. Existing data mining techniques are of little use for control-flow discovery, conformance checking, and other process mining tasks.

  abstract = {The Design and Engineering Methodology for Organisations (DEMO) is a core method within the discipline of Enterprise Engineering (EE). It enables the creation of so-called essential models of enterprises. Such models are enterprise models that aim to focus on the organisational essence of an enterprise by leaving out (as much as possible) details of the socio-technical implementation. The organisational essence is then expressed primarily in terms of the actor roles involved, and the business transactions between these roles. The DEMO method has a firm theoretical foundation. At the same time, there is an increasing uptake of DEMO in practice. This also results in a need for enterprise-grade tool support for the use of the method. In this thesis, we report on a study concerning the selection, configuration, and extension, of an enterprise-grade tool to support the use of DEMO in practice with the need of the automatic verification and exchange of DEMO models. The configuration of the selected tool framework to support DEMO modelling, provided general insights regarding the development of enterprise-grade tool support for (model-driven) methods such as DEMO, while also providing feedback on the consistency and completeness of the DEMO Specification Language (DEMOSL); the specification language that accompanies the DEMO method.},

  abstract = {Context Business process modeling is an essential part of understanding and redesigning the activities that a typical enterprise uses to achieve its business goals. The quality of a business process model has a significant impact on the development of any enterprise and IT support for that process. Objective Since the insights on what constitutes modeling quality are constantly evolving, it is unclear whether research on business process modeling quality already covers all major aspects of modeling quality. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the state of the art on business process modeling quality: What aspects of process modeling quality have been addressed until now and which gaps remain to be covered? Method We performed a systematic literature review of peer reviewed articles as published between 2000 and August 2013 on business process modeling quality. To analyze the contributions of the papers we use the Formal Concept Analysis technique. Results We found 72 studies addressing quality aspects of business process models. These studies were classified into different dimensions: addressed model quality type, research goal, research method, and type of research result. Our findings suggest that there is no generally accepted framework of model quality types. Most research focuses on empirical and pragmatic quality aspects, specifically with respect to improving the understandability or readability of models. Among the various research methods, experimentation is the most popular one. The results from published research most often take the form of intangible knowledge. Conclusion We believe there is a lack of an encompassing and generally accepted definition of business process modeling quality. This evidences the need for the development of a broader quality framework capable of dealing with the different aspects of business process modeling quality. Different dimensions of business process quality and of the process of modeling still require further research.},

The deliverable of the proposed modelling environment is an executable platform independent model (EPIM) that is further tested and validated through an MDA-based simulation feature. The proposed environment addresses a set of challenges associated with 1. shortcomings of the UML for being technically too complex for conceptual modelling goals as well as for being not precise enough  for rapid prototyping; 2. difficulties of MDE adoption due to the large set of required skills to adopt the key MDA standards such as the UML and XMI for developing and maintaining a requirements prototyping tools.

  abstract = {Purpose – To explore the current literature base of critical success factors (CSFs) of ERP implementations, prepare a compilation, and identify any gaps that might exist. Design/methodology/approach – Hundreds of journals were searched using key terms identified in a preliminary literature review. Successive rounds of article abstract reviews resulted in 45 articles being selected for the compilation. CSF constructs were then identified using content analysis methodology and an inductive coding technique. A subsequent critical analysis identified gaps in the literature base. Findings – The most significant finding is the lack of research that has focused on the identification of CSFs from the perspectives of key stakeholders. Additionally, there appears to be much variance with respect to what exactly is encompassed by change management, one of the most widely cited CSFs, and little detail of specific implementation tactics. Research limitations/implications – There is a need to focus future research efforts on the study of CSFs as they apply to the perspectives of key stakeholders and to ensure that this stakeholder approach is also comprehensive in its coverage of CSFs. As well, there is need to conduct more in‐depth research into the concept of change management. One key limitation of this research is the occurrence of duplication in the frequency analysis of the success factors. This is attributed to secondary research being the main methodology for a large number of the articles cited.

We propose the establishment of process science, a field that studies processes: coherent series of changes, both man-made and naturally occurring, that unfold over time and occur at various levels. Process science is concerned with understanding and influencing change. It entails discovering and understanding processes as well as designing interventions to shape them into desired directions. Process science is based on four key principles; it (1) puts processes at the center of attention, (2) investigates processes scientifically, (3) embraces perspectives of multiple disciplines, and (4) aims to create impact by actively shaping the unfolding of processes. The ubiquitous availability of digital trace data, combined with advanced data analytics capabilities, offer new and unprecedented opportunities to study processes through multiple data sources, which makes process science very timely.},

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

  abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) is the art and science of how work should be performed in an organization in order to ensure consistent outputs and to take advantage of improvement opportunities, e.g. reducing costs, execution times or error rates. Importantly, BPM is not about improving the way individual activities are performed, but rather about managing entire chains of events, activities and decisions that ultimately produce added value for an organization and its customers. This textbook encompasses the entire BPM lifecycle, from process identification to process monitoring, covering along the way process modelling, analysis, redesign and automation. Concepts, methods and tools from business management, computer science and industrial engineering are blended into one comprehensive and inter-disciplinary approach. The presentation is illustrated using the BPMN industry standard defined by the Object Management Group and widely endorsed by practitioners and vendors worldwide.    In addition to explaining the relevant conceptual background, the book provides dozens of examples, more than 100 hands-on exercises – many with solutions – as well as numerous suggestions for further reading. The textbook is the result of many years of combined teaching experience of the authors, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels as well as in the context of professional training. Students and professionals from both business management and computer science will benefit from the step-by-step style of the textbook and its focus on fundamental concepts and proven methods. Lecturers will appreciate the class-tested format and the additional teaching material available on the accompanying website fundamentals-of-bpm.org.},

Continuous technological advancements such as statistical computing and large language models allow for an increasingly natural and effortless interaction, as well as domain-agnostic deployment opportunities. Ultimately, this evolution begs multiple questions: How have technical capabilities developed? How is the nature of work changed through humans’ interaction with conversational agents? How has research framed dominant perceptions and depictions of such agents? And what is the path forward? To address these questions, we conducted a bibliometric study including over 5000 research articles on CAs. Based on a systematic analysis of keywords, topics, and author networks, we derive “five waves of CA research” that describe the past, present, and potential future of research on CAs. Our results highlight fundamental technical evolutions and theoretical paradigms in CA research. Therefore, we discuss the moderating role of big technologies, and novel technological advancements like OpenAI GPT or BLOOM NLU that mark the next frontier of CA research. We contribute to theory by laying out central research streams in CA research, and offer practical implications by highlighting the design and deployment opportunities of CAs.},

Het boek geeft handreikingen en praktijkvoorbeelden. Daarmee is het een praktische en inspirerende informatiebron voor opleidingen, examencommissies, toetscommissies en (aankomende) docenten. In deze vierde druk staan nieuwe hoofdstukken over onder meer de kwaliteitspiramide, het samenwerken bij toetsontwikkeling, het toetsen van creativiteit en over de rechtsbescherming van examinandi. De hoofdstukken over digitaal toetsen en ervaringscertificaten (EVC) zijn herschreven. Bijvoorbeeld met extra informatie over flexibel onderwijs. In ieder hoofdstuk is veel aandacht voor de rol van de docent. Toetsen in het hoger onderwijs kan gebruikt worden om een goed toetsbeleid op te zetten en uit te voeren. Daarmee is het geschikt om het certificaat Basiskwalificatie Examinering (BKE) en het Seniorkwalificatie Examinering (SKE) te behalen. Het boek is toegankelijk en daarom ook goed bruikbaar voor toetsconstructie in het voortgezet onderwijs en middelbaar beroepsonderwijs.}

Based on the data collected from 204 medium- to high-level business executives in various industries, the results of this empirical study indicate that the adoption of BA positively influences BPER. There is also positive relationship between BPER and FP. Finally, the results show that BPER fully mediates the relationship between BA adoption and FP.},

This makes it hard to keep up with state-of-the-art and to be at the forefront of research, as well as to assess the collective evidence in a particular area of business research. This is why the literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever. Traditional literature reviews often lack thoroughness and rigor and are conducted ad hoc, rather than following a specific methodology. Therefore, questions can be raised about the quality and trustworthiness of these types of reviews. This paper discusses literature review as a methodology for conducting research and offers an overview of different types of reviews, as well as some guidelines to how to both conduct and evaluate a literature review paper. It also discusses common pitfalls and how to get literature reviews published.},

While many contributions in the literature focus on the determinants of ERM adoption and use one-dimensional feature to proxy for ERM implementation, we detect the consequences of ERM implementation and capture a variety of features to measure the sophistication of the ERM system. The results show that firms with advanced levels of ERM implementation present higher performance, both as financial performance and market evaluation. Additional tests also corroborate the expectation that effective ERM systems lead to higher performance by reducing risk exposure and that reverse causality between ERM and performance is not present in the short term. The study provides a twofold contribution to the ERM literature. First, it introduces new and more complete measures for ERM implementation, concerning not only corporate governance bodies dedicated to risk management, but also the characteristics of the risk assessment process. Moreover, it provides evidence of a positive relationship between ERM implementation and firm performance in an underinvestigated context such as Italy.},

It discusses how, in the absence of a globally integrated financial framework, past and present regulations and interventions in reaction to national and global financial crises did not resolve the cross border regulatory arbitrage. The paper discusses how crises often lead to the emergence of new national and international institutions. It also analyses the proposed ‘‘new global framework” that needs to be in place if the policy recommendations contained in the G20 communiqué are going to be effectively implemented. The paper argues that unless international agreements are ratified by all nations and become part of national rules and laws, the presence of regulatory arbitrage and the lack of adequate cross border information and data may prevent the global economy from addressing the underlying causes of the recent global financial crisis. The paper also discusses the evolution of central banks and their new role in contributing to global financial stability. The paper argues that the recent global financial crisis has provided a unique opportunity to go beyond economic data and attempt to capture cross border financial data and other information that could assist international and national institutions to measure and manage financial risk more effectively. Finally, the paper discusses ‘‘too big to fail” and argues that only an internationally integrated financial system will make large banks global, both when operational and in the event of insolvency.},

They are fostering awareness and process-related communication by leveraging the benefits of visual notations. However, in contrast to business process diagrams, where nowadays BPMN prevails, process landscape diagrams lack standardization. Accordingly, the main objective of our efforts is to define an effective language for modeling of process landscapes, which is visually compliant with current landscape modeling approaches and structurally related to the BPMN standard. This was achieved by following the design science research methodology in which the proposed solution (named BPMN-L) was characterized, designed, and implemented by analyzing existing process landscape languages and approaches. Afterward, BPMN-L based diagrams were demonstrated and validated quantitatively and with a ‘proof-of-concept’ approach. The results show that BPMN-L is visually compatible with current landscape modeling approaches, especially value chains as well it suits well with multi-abstraction layered modeling based on BPMN. The investigated sample landscape diagrams demonstrate that all concepts, which are specified in BPMN-L, are applicable also in practice. Overall, the proposed solution has the potential to standardize and simplify process landscape discovery and modeling, semi-automate triggering of processes in a value chain and improve the consistency as well as the compatibility of processes architectures.},

We, therefore, introduce xbrl tagging as a new entity extraction task for the financial domain and release finer-139, a dataset of 1.1M sentences with gold xbrl tags. Unlike typical entity extraction datasets, finer139 uses a much larger label set of 139 entity types. Most annotated tokens are numeric, with the correct tag per token depending mostly on context, rather than the token itself. We show that subword fragmentation of numeric expressions harms bert’s performance, allowing word-level bilstms to perform better. To improve bert’s performance, we propose two simple and effective solutions that replace numeric expressions with pseudotokens reflecting original token shapes and numeric magnitudes. We also experiment with fin-bert, an existing bert model for the financial domain, and release our own bert (sec-bert), pre-trained on financial filings, which performs best. Through data and error analysis, we finally identify possible limitations to inspire future work on xbrl tagging.},

  abstract = {Business process management has become the most widely-used and reliable approach to organizational management over the last decades. It is also considered as a part of quality management system in an organization. Business process modeling is the core of business process management, which is used for visualization, analysis, and improvement of organizational activities. Moreover, business process modeling plays an important role in the context of business process management maturity of an overall enterprise. Therefore, this paper is focused on the problem of business process model quality evaluation. Existing approaches based on the process modeling guidelines, measures and corresponding thresholds are reviewed, as well as the refined process modeling rules, corresponding quality criteria, the generalized quality criterion, and thresholds for its translation into linguistic values are proposed. The data model and software prototype are developed and the validation results are outlined.},

The concept was articulated in 1998 by Charles Hoffman, known as XFRML (eXtensible Financial Reporting Mark Up Language) to facilitate the business reporting process and improve financial reporting. The objective of this paper is to examine a decade (1998-2008) of XBRL articles published in various publications including trade, practitioner and academic journals to identify trends and patterns, milestones, and organizations actively contributed to this development. Another goal is to assess public perceptions of XBRL, its capabilities and its future. We examined published articles where XBRL appeared either in the title or abstract of the article during 1998-2008. Considering that XBRL reporting is being required only in recent years, the research shows various interest groups worked together for a long time to achieve a common goal. The academic community has also been proactive in contributing to and assessing this new reporting standard. There is a trail of research articles to document this contribution. This paper provides various charts and interesting statistics.},

A number of research surveys have however shown that such programs are particularly prone to errors. Some reasons for the error-proneness of spreadsheets are that spreadsheets are developed by end users and that standard software quality assurance processes are mostly not applied. Correspondingly, during the last two decades, researchers have proposed a number of techniques and automated tools aimed at supporting the end user in the development of error-free spreadsheets. In this paper, we provide a review of the research literature and develop a classification of automated spreadsheet quality assurance (QA) approaches, which range from spreadsheet visualization, static analysis and quality reports, over testing and support to model-based spreadsheet development. Based on this review, we outline possible opportunities for future work in the area of automated spreadsheet QA.},

  abstract = {To survive, nascent grassroots organizations—and their respective causes—must earn the trust of various audiences that can impact credibility advancement. However, it can be quite difficult for grassroots organizations to access suitable settings, times, and collocated audiences. One context that can yield this type of access is an event, as it constitutes a rare opportunity for organizations to engage in practices that impact credibility advancement. We investigate how a volunteer-based grassroots organization orchestrates a high-profile event at the United Nations to promote African diaspora entrepreneurs as a valuable force in the mitigation of development challenges in their home countries. We employ qualitative data collected from ethnographic observations, interviews, and secondary sources and apply grounded theory approaches to demonstrate how organizational credibility can be advanced through performative strategizing within event settings. Drawing from heuristics used in theatrical performances, we found that the grassroots organization mobilized specific audience groups in participative role-playing across two acts, thereby producing and consecrating a temporary simulacrum of a cause-related community it claimed to represent. Our findings demonstrate how an unproven organization can strategically use audience mobilization to convert event settings into performative spaces for simulacrum creation and credibility advancement.},

We propose the construction of a taxonomy that can be straightforwardly embedded in the capital framework of banks, insurers and other regulated financial institutions around the world. The approach presented builds on approaches commonly adopted by banks and provides a prudential means to identify and capitalise the relevant risks. We highlight the dangers of potential miss-pricing of risk that could occur under a pure green-taxonomy if risk weights are reduced for assets deemed ”green”. Furthermore we investigate a number of the risks namely asset values (equity) and credit risks for European electrical utility companies and highlight how financial organisations would be able to capture the risks within their current framework. The approach utilises a long term simulation framework from an integrated assessment model that drives company investment choices over the simulation horizon. This approach gives rise to estimates of equity valuation, bond prices, credit ratings and default probabilities that can be used to assess long term credit exposures or potential shifts in current market valuation.},

  abstract = {Risk-aware Business Process Management (R-BPM) has been addressed in research since more than a decade. However, the integration of the two independent research streams is still ongoing with a lack of research focusing on the conceptual modeling perspective. Such an integration results in an increased meta-model complexity and a higher entry barrier for modelers in creating conceptual models and for addressees of the models in comprehending them. Multi-view modeling can reduce this complexity by providing multiple interdependent viewpoints that, all together, represent a complex system. Each viewpoint only covers those concepts that are necessary to separate the different concerns of stakeholders. However, adopting multi-view modeling discloses a number of challenges particularly related to managing consistency which is threatened by semantic and syntactic overlaps between the viewpoints. Moreover, usability and efficiency of multi-view modeling have never been systematically evaluated. This paper reports on the conceptualization, implementation, and empirical evaluation of e-BPRIM, a multi-view modeling extension of the Business Process-Risk Management-Integrated Method (BPRIM). The findings of our research contribute to theory by showing, that multi-view modeling outperforms diagram-oriented modeling by means of usability and efficiency of modeling, and quality of models. Moreover, the developed modeling tool is openly available, allowing its adoption and use in R-BPM practice. Eventually, the detailed presentation of the conceptualization serves as a blueprint for other researchers aiming to harness multi-view modeling.},

  abstract = {Measuring international research collaboration (IRC) is essential to various research assessment tasks but the effect of various measurement decisions, including which data sources to use, has not been thoroughly studied. To better understand the effect of data source choice on IRC measurement, we design and implement a data quality assessment framework specifically for bibliographic data by reviewing and selecting available dimensions and designing appropriate computable metrics, and then validate the framework by applying it to four popular sources of bibliographic data: Microsoft Academic Graph, Web of Science (WoS), Dimensions, and the ACM Digital Library. Successful validation of the framework suggests it is consistent with the popular conceptual framework of information quality proposed by Wang and Strong (1996) and adequately identifies the differences in quality in the sources examined. Application of the framework reveals that WoS has the highest overall quality among the sets considered; and that the differences in quality can be explained primarily by how the data sources are organized. Our study comprises a methodological contribution that enables researchers to apply this IRC measurement tool in their studies and makes an empirical contribution by further characterizing four popular sources of bibliographic data and their impact on IRC measurement.},

We theorize how the ongoing technological developments reinforce the traditional functions of data as instruments of management and control but also reframe and extend their role. By rendering data as technical entities, digital technologies transform the process of knowing and the knowledge functions data fulfil in socioeconomic life. These functions are most of the times mediated by putting together disperse and steadily updatable data in more stable entities we refer to as data objects. Users, customers, products, physical machines rendered as data objects become the technical and cognitive means through which organizational knowledge, patterns and practices develop. Such conditions loosen the dependence of data from domain knowledge, reorder the relative significance of internal versus external references in organizations, and contribute to a paradigmatic contemporary development that we identify with the decentering of organizations of which digital platforms are an important specimen.},

Intelligent autonomous robots, independent if they are humanoid/anthropomorphic or not, will have a physical presence, make autonomous decisions, and interact with all stakeholders in the society, in yet unforeseen manners. The symbiosis with such sophisticated robots may lead to a fundamental civilizational shift, with far-reaching effects as philosophical, legal, and societal questions on consciousness, citizenship, rights, and legal entity of robots are raised. The aim of this work is to understand the broad scope of potential issues pertaining to law and society through the investigation of the interplay of law, robots, and society via different angles such as law, social, economic, gender, and ethical perspectives. The results make it evident that in an era of symbiosis with intelligent autonomous robots, the law systems, as well as society, are not prepared for their prevalence. Therefore, it is now the time to start a multi-disciplinary stakeholder discussion and derive the necessary policies, frameworks, and roadmaps for the most eminent issues.},

Industry solutions offer tagging mechanisms to map regulations to operational specifics; however, they are mostly semi-formal in nature and tend to rely extensively on experts. We propose to use Semantics of Business Vocabularies and Rules along with similarity measures to create an explicit mapping between concepts of regulations and models of operational specifics of the enterprise.

Multidisciplinaire en iteratieve samenwerking tussen juristen, uitvoeringsdeskundigen, kennismodelleurs en softwareontwikkelaars is daarbij essentieel.

They are heavily regulated and there have been a significant number of well publicized compliance failings in recent years. This is despite Business Process Compliance (BPC) being both a well researched domain in academia and one where significant progress has been made. This study seeks to determine why Australian banks find BPC so challenging. We interviewed 22 senior managers from a range of functions within the four major Australian banks to identify the key challenges. Not every process in every bank is facing the same issues, but in processes where a bank is particularly challenged to meet its compliance requirements, the same themes emerge. The compliance requirement load they bear is excessive, dynamic and complex. Fulfilling these requirements relies on impenetrable spaghetti processes, and the case for sustainable change remains elusive, locking banks into a fail-fix cycle that increases the underlying complexity. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that identifies and aggregates the challenges, and a circuit-breaker approach as an “off ramp” to the fail-fix cycle.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the recent development in audit technologies, i.e., the rise of Big Data and Analytics (BDA) tools, and how auditors make use of them in audits. While prior audit studies have acknowledged that audit technologies shape and re-construct the market for audit services, they have not devoted much attention to the performative nature of such technologies and how their properties may shape the dynamics of technological change. Drawing on sociomateriality literature as well as observations, documentary materials and 25 semi-structured interviews with individuals directly engaging with BDA, this study explores how BDA users interact with particular properties of the technology in the course of an audit. We then consider how these interactions reconfigure aspects of the audit process and change the relational dynamics within audit firms. In particular, our findings suggest that properties of BDA such as scripts have afforded large-scale automation of audit routines, generating opportunities for expanding the evidential scope and depth of audit work. Further, we also show how the visualization dashboards have contributed to auditors’ ability to communicate and justify their claims and judgements. Finally, we demonstrate that BDA has reshaped the nature of work relationships and flows between audit firms’ different functions and service lines.},

  abstract = {We present a discipline for verifiable computational scientific research. Our discipline revolves around three simple new concepts – verifiable computational result (VCR), VCR repository and Verifiable Result Identifier (VRI). These are web- and cloud-computing oriented concepts, which exploit today’s web infrastructure to achieve standard, simple and automatic reproducibility in computational scientific research. The VCR discipline requires very slight modifications to the way researchers already conduct their computational research and authoring, and to the way publishers manage their content. In return, the discipline marks a significant step towards delivering on the long-anticipated promises of making scientific computation truly reproducible.},

From the paper, readers in the scientific community are expected to extract all the relevant information necessary to reproduce and validate the results presented by the paper’s authors. However, the increased use of computer software in science makes reproducing scientific results increasingly difficult. The research paper in its current state is no longer sufficient to fully reproduce, validate, or review a paper’s experimental results and conclusions. This impedes scientific progress. To remedy these concerns, we introduce Paper Maˆche´, a new system for creating dynamic, executable research papers. The key novelty of Paper Maˆch´e is its use of virtual machines, which lets readers and reviewers easily view and interact with a paper, and reproduce key experimental results. For authors, the Paper Maˆche´ workbench provides an easy-touse interface to build an executable paper. By transforming the static research paper into a dynamic and interactive entity, Paper Maˆche´ brings the presentation of scientific results into the 21st century. We believe that Paper Maˆche´ will become indispensable to the scientific process, and increase the visibility of key findings among members and non-members of the scientific community.},

  abstract = {Organizations are increasingly interested in classifying texts or parts thereof into categories, as this enables more effective use of their information. Manual procedures for text classification work well for up to a few hundred documents. However, when the number of documents is larger, manual procedures become laborious, time-consuming, and potentially unreliable. Techniques from text mining facilitate the automatic assignment of text strings to categories, making classification expedient, fast, and reliable, which creates potential for its application in organizational research. The purpose of this article is to familiarize organizational researchers with text mining techniques from machine learning and statistics. We describe the text classification process in several roughly sequential steps, namely training data preparation, preprocessing, transformation, application of classification techniques, and validation, and provide concrete recommendations at each step. To help researchers develop their own text classifiers, the R code associated with each step is presented in a tutorial. The tutorial draws from our own work on job vacancy mining. We end the article by discussing how researchers can validate a text classification model and the associated output.},

  abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) has proven successful to help organizations improve and innovate, and its application has grown in scope and context. One essential problem related to this development is that the BPM body of knowledge does not account for a broader variety of business contexts. On the contrary, most approaches, methods, or models in BPM suggest one way forward, and we recognize that BPM projects following a one-size-fits-all approach are prone to fail, since they do not sufficiently consider situational requirements. In this viewpoint article, we argue that BPM needs to be contextual in order for projects to be most efficient and effective. We observe a lack of research on how to identify and characterize business contexts relevant for tailoring the right BPM approach. Therefore, we examine contextual factors that influence BPM and propose a framework to identify the context in which BPM is applied. We define context in BPM as situational factors related to goal-, process-, organization-, and environment-dimensions. Our viewpoint article not only creates awareness for contextual BPM, it also intends to stimulate research on the role of context in BPM and to help practitioners better understand the specific business context in which BPM initiatives are applied.},

  abstract = {The meaning of words can change over time. In addition, new words may enter a language, sometimes replacing other words. This article extends prior literature on language change in accounting by drawing to a larger extent on theories from linguistics, and by placing greater emphasis on mechanisms of and motivations for change. Particular emphasis is placed on the need to verbalize new concepts, and sociocultural change. The latter is illustrated with examples from the development of accounting as an occupational interest group, and the adoption of Anglo-American accounting terminology and culture. The article concludes that language change in accounting, including transmission between languages and cultures, can inform accounting historians about the transfer of technical developments, as well as about socio-economic, political or ideological processes, power relationships, and the importance of terminology in jurisdictional disputes.},

Such decision-intensive processes are driven by data and require flexibility in their execution. Business artifacts model data and process aspects of business entities in a holistic way and are therefore well-suited to model data-driven processes. Declarative process models support flexible process executions. Therefore, declarative business artifacts are a promising ingredient to support decision-intensive processes. However, there are several challenges that need to be overcome in order to support real-world decision-intensive processes with declarative business artifacts. This position paper discusses key challenges and discusses preliminary solutions to overcome them and turn declarative business artifacts into a mature modeling language for decision-intensive processes.},

  abstract = {Domain specific languages (DSLs) bring substantial increase in productivity and quality and thus look very appealing to software engineering practitioners. Because language workbenches can drastically reduce the cost of building and maintaining DSLs and associated tooling, they catch the attention of technical leads and project managers in the industry. Effective use of language engineering technologies for software development requires specific knowledge about building DSLs in general and about language workbenches in particular. Practicing software engineers need to enrich their skills with a new software development approach and the supporting tools. In this paper we present our experiences with training and coaching software practitioners in developing domain specific languages and the associated tooling with Jetbrains’ Meta-Programming System. We distill the experience that we have gained over the last three years while running 16 trainings organized by three different organizations. The trainings were attended by over 50 developers, who work in different business domains and posses a wide variety of technical backgrounds, previous experiences and concrete needs. We present a set of challenges faced while teaching language engineering technologies in the industry. To address these challenges we developed a curriculum containing increasingly complex topics and an approach, which combines classical trainings with continuous coaching either remotely or on site. Based on our experience we distill a set of lessons learnt about the dissemination of language engineering technologies to practitioners. We identify several concrete needs which are key to broader adoption of language engineering in practice.},

Sophisticated financial statement users (financial analysts and professional accountants) and less sophisticated financial statement users (MBA students) extracted information from a set of financial statements that included an income statement either in the IAS 1 format or in the matrix format. We find that the matrix format improves the accuracy with which users extract financial information. This result is driven by greater accuracy, for all users groups, on ‘below-the-line’ items. Furthermore, despite lack of familiarity with the matrix format, its use does not appear to affect the time taken, the ease of extracting financial information, or users’ task completion confidence. These findings may assist the FASB and IASB in their joint project on financial statement presentation.},

We find substantial levels of common sentences used by the firms, including a few cases where the codes of ethics are essentially identical. We consider these results in the context of legal statements versus value statements. While legal writing often mandates duplication, we argue that value-based statements should be held to a higher standard of originality. Our evidence is consistent with isomorphic pressures on smaller firms to conform.},

In analyzing employees, FES consists of nine factors; however, those nine factors are considered to be insufficient. Hence, the researchers used the process mining method to improve FES. Process mining analyzes job performance in details. The steps taken in process mining consist of time stamp, case, activity, and resources of employee. This means that the method can be continuously used, since the researcher provides weight for each factor. The weight of each factor is obtained from Analytic Hierarchy Process-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. The result shows that FES with process mining are good for job performance but AHP-TOPSIS is considered to be incompatible for usage compared to the real work because the priority of the FES factors from the method is inconsistent with the priority factor made by manager of the warehouse officer.},

The objective of this article is to gain profound insights into the maturity of different data-centric approaches as well as their capabilities. In particular, this article will provide a framework for systematically evaluating and comparing data-centric approaches, with regard to the phases of the business process lifecycle. To this end, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted with the goal of evaluating the capabilities of data-centric process management approaches. The SLR comprises 38 primary studies which were thoroughly analyzed. The studies were categorized into different approaches, whose capabilities were thoroughly assessed. Special focus was put on the tooling and software of the approaches. The article provides the empirically grounded DALEC framework to evaluate and compare data-centric approaches. Furthermore, the results of the SLR offer insights into existing data-centric approaches and their capabilities. Data-centric approaches promise better support of loosely structured and data-intensive business processes, which may not be adequately represented by activity-centric paradigms.},

  abstract = {The growing interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues is the result of a cultural path that sees banks react to market changes and become protagonists of an increasingly sustainable future. Based on these considerations, this paper intends to investigate the level of integration of sustainability issues in banks’ corporate governance systems. We carry out an exploratory analysis on all European systematically important banks during the period 2015–2019. By adopting the content analysis approach, we develop a novel governance score based on a research model made up of 40 items. We name the score: “Bank’s governance ESG (Environmental Social Governance) integrated index”. The main results of our study reveal not only growing awareness of banks to integrate sustainability in their corporate governance, but also a strong heterogeneity in their corporate behaviours and large rooms for improvement. Indeed, we find that just over half of the surveyed banks pay really attention to the integration of sustainability issues in their business and governance processes. This contribution is especially driven by the banks’ boards of directors, whose size and composition contribute positively to overall sustainable performance. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirical study that investigates the level of integration of ESG factors in the banking sector, developing a quantitative score ranging from 0 to 100\%. This study differs from previous studies in that it develops an “Bank’s governance ESG integrated index”, which considers the areas of corporate governance that have the greatest impact on the implementation of sustainable practices in banks. Our research is limited to investigating the level of integration of ESG factors for listed banks over a 5-year period. In fact, our time horizon is represented by the four-year period 2015–2019. This research has practical implications. First, investors more attentive on sustainability issues could identify and select the banks that best implement ESG criteria in their corporate governance systems. Second, our research model could be adopted by banks as a “diagnostic tool” to carry out a self-assessment process and identify possible room for improvement.},

But while most investors would say they have been rewarded with good performance, this success is hard to objectively demonstrate due to intransitive metrics and unmeasured risks. It is our belief that there is a pressing need to substantiate the economic case for private equity. In this article, we describe a new transparency framework, which we situate in our research agenda on ‘organic finance’. The framework uses data science technology to operationalize private equity data and institute a scientific approach to performance measurement. We elucidate what scientific measurement should look like in private equity, incorporating examples of technologies in use today. We also reveal how bringing new levels of transparency into the asset class can, on its own, create significant value. Finally, we look at the effect of organic finance on the industry, connecting greater transparency to a structural shift that enables efficiencies, expansion, and innovation. The magnitude and sustainability of this shift reinforces the economic case for private equity, albeit with far more transparency than is practiced today.},

In making sense of digital transformation, we discovered that leaders in various industry circles use the term inconsistently to describe various strategizing and organizing activities; in addition, the term has gained limited scholarly attention as a context for study of strategic change. Drawing on senior executives' experiences with leading digitalization projects at incumbent firms, we propose a process model comprising of nine microfoundations to reveal the generic contingency factors that trigger, enable, and hinder the building of dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Our findings reveal that digital transformation is an ongoing process of using new digital technologies in everyday organizational life, which recognizes agility as the core mechanism for the strategic renewal of an organization's (1) business model, (2) collaborative approach, and eventually the (3) culture.},

We compare the performance of a baseline setup, where GPT-4 is directly asked to explain a legal term, to an augmented approach, where a legal information retrieval module is used to provide relevant context to the model, in the form of sentences from case law. We found that the direct application of GPT-4 yields explanations that appear to be of very high quality on their surface. However, detailed analysis uncovered limitations in terms of the factual accuracy of the explanations. Further, we found that the augmentation leads to improved quality, and appears to eliminate the issue of hallucination, where models invent incorrect statements. These findings open the door to the building of systems that can autonomously retrieve relevant sentences from case law and condense them into a useful explanation for legal scholars, educators or practicing lawyers alike.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             There is a large body of accounting research literature examining the use of analytical procedures by auditors and proposing either new types of analytical procedures or more effective ways of implementing existing procedures. In this paper, we demonstrate—using procurement data from a leading global bank—the value added in an audit setting of a new type of analytical procedure: process mining of event logs. In particular, using process mining, we are able to identify numerous transactions that we consider to be audit-relevant information, including payments made without approval, violations of segregation of duty controls, and violations of company-specific internal procedures. Furthermore, these identified anomalies were not detected by the bank's internal auditors when they conducted their examination of that same data using conventional audit procedures, thus establishing the benefits of using process mining to complement existing audit methods. Process mining is a very different approach to evidence collection and analysis as it does not focus on the value of transactions and its aggregations, but on the transactional processes themselves. In addition to demonstrating the benefits of process mining in an audit context, this paper also discusses the contributions that process mining can make both to accounting research and auditing practice.},

  abstract = {Financial reports are commonplace in the business world, but are long and tedious to produce. These reports mostly consist of tables with written sections describing these tables. Automating the process of creating these reports, even partially has the potential to save a company time and resources that could be spent on more creative tasks. Some software exists which uses conditional statements and sentence templates to generate the written sections. This solution lacks creativity and innovation when compared to recent advancements in NLP and deep learning. We instead implement a transformer network to solve the task of generating this text. By generating matching pairs between tables and sentences found in financial documents, we created a dataset for our transformer. We were able to achieve promising results, with the final model reaching a BLEU score of 63.3. Generated sentences are natural, grammatically correct and mostly faithful to the information found in the tables.},

The results reveal a) a broad view of foundations for DSR by incorporating artifacts that are used in practice, b) the focus on the organization as the unit of analysis, c) a pluralism of research methods that cater to the timeliness of problems addressed, and d) low level of theoretical underpinnings, thus lacking in DSR rigor aspects.},

This has put increasing pressure on banks to monitor and report a range of intricate exposures to comply with new prudential requirements. Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is an emerging technology trend leveraging Information Technology and Digital Innovations that can greatly assist with a bank’s regulatory management process. A consideration is that these technologies can sometimes be expensive and inefficient if deployed on an ad hoc and stand-alone basis. An option is to incorporate RegTech into the digital transformation strategy of a management function such as Treasury. Integrated adoption would mean the digital platform can be deployed to support both strategic management activities and enhanced regulatory processes within Treasury, thereby ensuring commercial and prudential objectives are aligned. RegTech can provide an invaluable tool, in a business-as-usual environment, as well as in real-life stress events, such as the recent Coronavirus outbreak. This paper explores the potential of RegTech and the merit of incorporating it into a smart Treasury department.},

  abstract = {Government agencies are becoming more data-driven and need high-quality data to fulfill their roles in society. In the past, each agency organized its own data exchange system according to its own needs. Today, data is distributed over many organizations, and government agencies need to adopt an ecosystem approach for data exchange. Fundamental in the ecosystem approach is the dependence on other parties for the execution of stewardship strategies. Data-driven government agencies increasingly depend on other organizations for highquality data and data stewardship across organizations is becoming more critical. While there is ample research on data stewardship within organizations, little is known about data stewardship in ecosystems. More specifically, it is unclear which data stewardship strategies government agencies can employ in ecosystems. The main goal of this explorative paper is to identify and compare data stewardship strategies used in empirical government-business ecosystems. Following an explorative case study approach, this paper reveals three different configurations of inter-organizational data stewardship: 1) the government-led ecosystem, 2) the government-business-led ecosystem, and 3) the regulation-led ecosystem. The case studies expose a wide array of data stewardship strategies across ecosystems. While the ecosystem approach provides advantages such as costsharing and innovation by private parties, government agencies become increasingly dependent on private parties to gain high-quality data and provide distributed infrastructure components. Maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks of the ecosystem approach requires government agencies to be cautious when selecting a specific ecosystem configuration.},

  abstract = {Like many other management systems, the compliance management system needs to be measured to know how exemplary the implementation is. The Compliance management maturity model (CMMM) is one measurement method that can help the organization assess the degree of Compliance Management implementation and the effectiveness of compliance management practices to help the organization achieve its objectives. To determine and identify the state-of-the-art CMMM, this study will enumerate and synthesize current CMMM and map their similarities and differences. Furthermore, to determine if the existing enterprise CMMM can measure the current Compliance Management practices by using the ISO 37301 international Standard as a proxy for a state-of-theart Compliance Management system. The synthesizing process of the enterprise CMMM uses the literature review approach on the existing CMMM and ISO 37301 as the primary benchmark reference. The findings show that despite organizations facing increasing complexity and organizational characteristics of internal and external regulations, the CMMM as Compliance Management measurement tools are very few. The result also shows that the existing CMMM cannot cover all the current CMMM requirements needed from the International Standard.},

Alternatively, the rules can be already taken into account while modeling the business process to result in a business process that is compliant by design. This technique has the advantage that a subsequent verification of compliance is not required.},

The number and complexity of these regulations is creating significant issues for governance, risk and compliance management especially for heavily-regulated sectors, such as the financial industry. This paper proposes a semanticallyenabled compliance management framework that backs up the entire business process compliance lifecycle, i.e., design-time verification, runtime and offline monitoring and analysis. In the heart of the framework is an integrated semantic repository incorporating domain, business and regulatory knowledge, at different levels of abstraction, which provides a shared conceptualization of the interrelated compliance and business specifics. Furthermore, given the technological revolution caused by cloud computing, we draw our vision on providing compliance-related ontologies as a service (COaaS) on the cloud. As an initial validation step, we have considered the financial sector with an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) case study and applied our semantic-based approach on.},

  abstract = {The requirements for Web applications concerning workflow execution, interaction, aesthetics, federation and Web service integration are steadily increasing. Considering their complexity, the development of these “rich workflow-based Web applications” requires a systematic approach taking key factors like strong user involvement and clear business objectives into account. To this end, we present an approach for the model-driven construction and evolution of such Web applications on the basis of workflow models which is founded on Domain-specific Languages (DSLs) and a supporting technical framework. We describe our approach’s core DSL for workflow modeling which supports various modeling notations like BPMN or Petri nets and outline a set of DSLs used for designing workflow activities like dialog construction, data presentation and Web service communication. In conclusion, rich workflow-based Web applications can be built by modeling workflows and activities and passing them to the associated technical framework. The resulting running prototype can then be configured in detail using the presented DSLs.},

  abstract = {Much time in process mining projects is spent on finding and understanding data sources and extracting the event data needed. As a result, only a fraction of time is spent actually applying techniques to discover, control and predict the business process. Moreover, current process mining techniques assume a single case notion. However, in reallife processes often different case notions are intertwined. For example, events of the same order handling process may refer to customers, orders, order lines, deliveries, and payments. Therefore, we propose to use Multiple Viewpoint (MVP) models that relate events through objects and that relate activities through classes. The required event data are much closer to existing relational databases. MVP models provide a holistic view on the process, but also allow for the extraction of classical event logs using different viewpoints. This way existing process mining techniques can be used for each viewpoint without the need for new data extractions and transformations. We provide a toolchain allowing for the discovery of MVP models (annotated with performance and frequency information) from relational databases. Moreover, we demonstrate that classical process mining techniques can be applied to any selected viewpoint.},

Sustainability reporting is an instrument of transparency regulation intended to influence management decisions. It requires disclosure of a large set of data points but does not provide aggregate measures. It is production-oriented and does not include accruals. It expands reporting to include disclosure of long-term policies and targets, and of information of firms in the value chain. Consequently, sustainability reporting is not very useful for tracking sustainability performance and for comparisons across firms. Overall, it would benefit from applying more generally accepted accounting concepts.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Reporting standards, such as PRISMA aim to ensure that the methods and results of systematic reviews are described in sufficient detail to allow full transparency. Flow diagrams in evidence syntheses allow the reader to rapidly understand the core procedures used in a review and examine the attrition of irrelevant records throughout the review process. Recent research suggests that use of flow diagrams in systematic reviews is poor and of low quality and called for standardised templates to facilitate better reporting in flow diagrams. The increasing options for interactivity provided by the Internet gives us an opportunity to support easy‐to‐use evidence synthesis tools, and here we report on the development of a tool for the production of PRISMA 2020‐compliant systematic review flow diagrams.                                         Methods and Findings                                We developed a free‐to‐use, Open Source R package and web‐based Shiny app to allow users to design PRISMA flow diagrams for their own systematic reviews. Our tool allows users to produce standardised visualisations that transparently document the methods and results of a systematic review process in a variety of formats. In addition, we provide the opportunity to produce interactive, web‐based flow diagrams (exported as HTML files), that allow readers to click on boxes of the diagram and navigate to further details on methods, results or data files. We provide an interactive example here;                 https://prisma-flowdiagram.github.io/                 .                                                        Conclusions                                We have developed a user‐friendly tool for producing PRISMA 2020‐compliant flow diagrams for users with coding experience and, importantly, for users without prior experience in coding by making use of Shiny (                 https://estech.shinyapps.io/prisma\_flowdiagram/                 ). This free‐to‐use tool will make it easier to produce clear and PRISMA 2020‐compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Significantly, users can also produce interactive flow diagrams for the first time, allowing readers of their reviews to smoothly and swiftly explore and navigate to further details of the methods and results of a review. We believe this tool will increase use of PRISMA flow diagrams, improve the compliance and quality of flow diagrams, and facilitate strong science communication of the methods and results of systematic reviews by making use of interactivity. We encourage the systematic review community to make use of the tool, and provide feedback to streamline and improve their usability and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Background: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did and what they found. Over the last decade, there have been many advances in systematic review methodology and terminology, which have necessitated an update to the guideline.Objectives: To develop the PRISMA 2020 statement for reporting systematic reviews.Methods: We reviewed 60 documents with reporting guidance for systematic reviews to generate suggested modifications to the PRISMA 2009 statement. We sought feedback on the suggested modifications through an online survey of 110 systematic review methodologists and journal editors. The results of the review and survey were discussed at a 21-member in-person meeting. Following the meeting, drafts of the PRISMA 2020 checklist, abstract checklist, explanation and elaboration and flow diagram were generated and refined iteratively based on feedback from co-authors and a convenience sample of 15 systematic reviewers.Results: In this statement paper, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews. The checklist includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement.Conclusions: The PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to facilitate transparent, complete and accurate reporting of systematic reviews. Improved reporting should benefit users of reviews, including guideline developers, policy makers, health care providers, patients and other stakeholders. In order to achieve this, we encourage authors, editors and peer-reviewers to adopt the guideline.},

This paper proposes a set of high level concepts covering the GRC domain. Through literature review and framework research we propose key functions of governance, risk and compliance and their associations, resulting in a reference conceptual model for integrated GRC.

Especially in the case of legacy tools, it turns out that even free software is often too costly (i.e., time-consuming) to be installed for evaluating the quality of a research contribution. After organizing a series of events related to software modeling, we have constructed (and started to use) SHARE, a system for sharing practically any type of software artifact to reviewers and to other participants who have very limited time available. The system relies on cloud-computing technologies to provide online access to interactive environments containing all the tools, documentation, input and output models to reproduce alleged research results. The system also enables one to clone such an environment and add additional models or tools in order to extend a contribution or pinpoint a problem. In retrospect, we observe that the approach is not limited to software modeling and SHARE is in fact gaining acceptance in other fields already.},

This paper proposes a software framework based on a semantic data model that helps in deriving and analysing regulatory reporting processes from event repositories. The key idea is in using business-like templates for expressing commonly used constraints associated with the definition of regulatory reporting processes and mapping these templates with those provided by an existing process definition language. A case study investigates the efficacy of the proposed solution in the case of an “Off-market bid” regulatory process. The results demonstrate the capability of the architecture in deriving process instances from a repository of Australian Company Announcements provided by the Australian Securities Exchange.},

  abstract = {The Semantic Web is becoming increasingly important for information systems and significant progress has been made in recent years in developing new ideas and tools. As the demand for semantically enabled applications increases, a diverse range of semantic web technologies (SWT) have emerged with the purpose of supporting the development of more intelligent information systems. The evolution and emergence of SWT is mostly fragmented lacking solution blueprints and guidance for organizations in the pathway of adopting SWT to address pragmatic problems. As a result, a majority of the semantically enabled applications in production and development are confined in smaller and trivial use cases. Operations in a controlled and simulated environment are often assumed. In this thesis, we focused on the study of novel semantic-based techniques and tools for addressing the current challenges and needs in domain of Regulatory Compliance Auditing. Regulatory Compliance Auditing involves many pragmatic use cases with effect on broad range of important actors in organizations. These problems could be solved and supported by SWT. For example, if SWT are used to model regulatory policies that relates to the regulations, it would make it simpler and easier for organizations and legislators to add, delete, modify and manage regulations while facilitating audits in an efficient manner. Adopting SWT in Regulatory Compliance Auditing is not without challenges. We have identified and then proposed solutions to address the challenges and issues. Solutions materialized from this thesis include a Semantic-based Reasoning Framework (SemRRF) and an Ontology-based Robust Production System (OntoRPS) that involves SWT such as Ontologies, Semantic-based Rules, Fuzzy Logic and Production Systems. Furthermore, we have described and demonstrated the generic usage and real world application of our proposed semantic-based solution by implementing SemRRF and OntoRPS and presenting a case study for addressing IT security compliance. We aim to use our studies in the Regulatory Compliance Auditing domain as solution guidance for organizations with plans to adopt SWT on more pragmatic, complex and important real-world problems. Another objective is to pioneer research on semantic-based approach to the ubiquitous Regulatory Compliance problems.},

As a motivation, the effectiveness of the SWRL/OWL combination in modeling domain facts is discussed while some of the common expressive limitations of the combination are also highlighted. The paper then classifies and presents the relevant language extensions of the SWRL and their added expressive powers to the original SWRL definition. Furthermore, it provides a comparative analysis of the syntax and semantics of the proposed extensions. In conclusion, the decidability requirement and usability of each expressiveness extension are evaluated towards an efficient inclusion into the OWL ontologies.},

To capture these business rules, organizations can choose between a multitude of commercially and scientifically available business rule languages. However, current languages are not precise enough and result in ambiguous business rules which cannot be interpreted by an automated information system. So, a need for a precise language to capture business rules can be identified. A specific notation form that can comply with a high level of precision, is a controlled natural language (CNL). During this research, a CNL is created which comprises: 15 fundamental constructs and an underlying formal grammar including 40 grammar rules. The created artifacts have been validated in three different rounds using sequentially 37 patterns, 252 business rules, and six business rules management systems by applying Mill’s Method which indicated usefulness and completeness.},

Previously surveys on BPC have been conducted with specific context in mind; however, the literature on BPC management research is largely sparse and does not accumulate a detailed understanding on existing literature and related issues faced by the domain. This survey provides a holistic view of the literature on existing BPC management approaches, and categories them based on different compliance management strategies in the context of formulated research questions. A systematic literature approach is used where search terms pertaining keywords were used to identify literature related to the research questions from scholarly databases. From initially 183 papers, we selected 79 papers related to the themes of this survey published between 2000–2015. The survey results reveal that mostly compliance management approaches center around three distinct categories namely: design-time (28\%), run-time (32\%) and auditing (10\%). Also, organisational and internal control based compliance management frameworks (21\%) and hybrid approaches make (9\%) of the surveyed approaches. Furthermore, open research challenges and gaps are identified and discussed with respect to the compliance problem.},

However, they better understand structured natural language, such as SBVR that defines the meaning of business concepts and make them unambiguously understandable by human experts and also by software systems. The solution presented in this paper allows transforming BPMN 2.0 business process models into SBVR business vocabularies and business rules. This solution is implemented as a plug-in and is available in the MagicDraw CASE tool. An experimental evaluation of the proposed solution with three domain areas proved that SBVR business vocabulary and business rules could be fully obtained from BPMN 2.0 business process model when certain requirements for BPMN 2.0 business process model are met. The advantages of the solution are an automatic transformation for various BPMN modelling situations, tracing links between two models in one modelling environment and avoidance of necessity to use linguistic techniques.},

We show that the practitioners we involved in this study are receptive to the idea of a hybrid approach combining imperative and declarative techniques, rather than making a full shift from the imperative to the declarative paradigm. Moreover, we report on requirements, use cases, limitations, and tool support of such a hybrid approach.

Proper curation facilitates interoperability and dissemination via other tools. We thus use popular python libraries (e.g. xarray, numpy, pandas) to query, manipulate and visualize the data and then build web applications to facilitate their exploration.

  abstract = {Today’s business environment demands a high rate of compliance of service-enabled business processes with which enterprises are required to cope. Thus, a comprehensive compliance management framework is required such that compliance management must crosscut all the stages of the complete business process lifecycle, starting from the very early stages of business process design. Formalizing compliance requirements based on a formal foundation of an expressive logical language enables the application of associated verification and analysis tools to ensure the compliance. In this paper, we have conducted a comparative analysis between three languages that can be used as the formal foundation of business process compliance requirements, focusing on design-time phase. Two main families of languages have been identified, which are: the temporal and deontic families of logic. In particular, we have considered LTL, CTL and FCL. The comparative analysis is based on the capabilities and limitations of each language and a set of required identified features.},

As the violation of such requirements may lead to significant punishment for an organization, compliance management should be supported at the very early stages of business process development. In this paper, we present an integrated approach to compliance management that helps process designers to adhere to compliance requirements relevant for their processes. Firstly, we introduce a conceptual model for specifying compliance requirements originating from various compliance sources. Secondly, we propose a framework for augmenting business processes with reusable fragments to ensure process compliance to certain requirements by design. Furthermore, we discuss the formalization of compliance requirements using mathematical logics and integrate the framework for process reuse with automated software verification tools.},

Regulatory and legislative measure have been introduced in response to these failures. However, arguments by sceptics advocate that it is time consuming and costly to comply these legislative measures that cause overregulation. These measures further do not always add value to business initiatives and adherence to these measures cannot be enforced or guaranteed. This paper argues for the use of business process management systems (BPMSs) to improve corporate governance. The “dynamics capabilities theory model of IT-enabled organisational performance” [1] is applied in this study as theoretical underpinning.

Although it is present in the banking activity from its origins, industry interest increases during last decades of XX century. Basel II gave significant incentives in managing operational risk processes in banks all over the world. New, Basel III regulation imposes improvement in operational risk management indirectly, through guidelines for better management of liquidity and credit risk, thus emphasizing the importance of the most intangible factors of operational risk – internal factor contained in inadequate processes and procedures. In Serbian banking system the most important contribution of Basel standard implementation was raising awareness of the presence of this kind of risk, although it is still in the initial phase. High impact on the operational risk drivers has macroeconomic environment, banking system structure and client type that are offered financial support. Having in mind that banks offers in Serbia are primarily oriented toward retail clients, it is not surprising that the most important factor of operational risk, regarding number of risk events, are human errors with 54\% in total. However, majority of financial losses are derived from clients’ frauds, more than 70\%. In this paper, author indicates the most important factors and events of operational risk that are present in retail banks in Serbia and their sources as a key element in mitigating their negative effects in the future.},

  abstract = {Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is nowadays a challenging task due to the large number of papers that typically compose the scientific material of the topic to review. Recently, a lot of research effort has been devoted to automate, even partially, the stages of an SLR. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a workflow and a set of tools – called slr-kit – to support key tasks in an SLR. The proposed approach leverages a semi-supervised strategy, in which time-consuming processes are carried out using automatic tools, whereas manual tasks have been optimized by carefully designed support tools to reduce the overall required effort. Important parts of the workflow include the extraction of key terms directly from the abstracts of the papers to survey, and the subsequent topic modeling that allows for a thematic clustering of the corpus of papers. In the proposed workflow, the former task is carried out by exploiting a novel tool, called FAst WOrd Classifier (FAWOC). The latter, instead, is designed to be automatically carried out by leveraging an ad-hoc solution based on the application of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. The result of the process consists in a set of statistics regarding the relationship among papers, topics, and their trend of publication on journals and conference proceedings. The validity of the method is demonstrated with an application to a dataset related to the scientific field of NLP, while its accuracy is assessed by the manual examination of the results by domain experts.},

  abstract = {Sustainability reporting has been increasingly adopted by corporations worldwide given the demand of stakeholders for greater transparency on both environmental and social issues. The popularity of such reporting is evidenced by the development of a range of tools in the last two decades e Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), AA1000 and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) inter alia. These tools, referred to collectively as corporate sustainability reporting tools (SRTs) are important as they serve to inform the progress of corporations towards achieving sustainability goals. However, the rapid growth of corporate SRTs, with different criteria and methodology has created major complications for stakeholders. This paper makes a genuine contribution by providing a review of some of these major tools, spanning across a wide spectrum - framework, standards, ratings and indices. A critique of SRTs is also given. Institutional investors, governments, practitioners and individuals may find this review useful in terms of understanding the nature of different corporate SRTs. As well, it can serve as a useful reference for the development of the next generation of corporate SRTs.},

For many tasks—including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses—the scientific literature needs to be checked systematically. Scholars and practitioners currently screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of simulation studies that active learning can yield far more efficient reviewing than manual reviewing while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the options of the free and open source research software and present the results from user experience tests. We invite the community to contribute to open source projects such as our own that provide measurable and reproducible improvements over current practice.},

  abstract = {For most global software companies with a client base that covers a large number of regulated businesses, regulatory compliance represents a significant challenge. The world of compliance has become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming number of regulations, laws, and standards that are introduced every year. These laws may vary significantly in their scope and applicability depending on the industry sector and the geographical area of the end client. In addition, many of these laws are created by different legislative bodies resulting in overlapping and sometimes conflicting provisions. To further complicate matters, laws are often created based on existing ones, forming a complex set of interdependent rules where changes made in one place can propagate to affect, sometimes in an inconsistent manner, many other laws. There is clearly a need to investigate techniques and tools that can alleviate IT solution providers from the complexity of dealing with regulatory compliance. In this paper, we present an approach and a supporting tool that aim to facilitate the analysis of multiple regulations. Our approach is based on the exploration of the citation relationship that links various laws together. The citation relationship is represented by a citation graph that can be used by an analyst to navigate through the provisions of various interrelated laws to uncover overlaps and possible conflicts or to simply understand the content of specific law documents. We also present a tool called CompDSS (Compliance Decision Support System) that supports our approach. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the presented approach by applying it to three regulations, namely, SOX, HIPAA, and GLBA.},

DFAs can be used as a fundamental building block to support not only the development of process analysis techniques, but also the implementation of instruments to support other phases of the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle such as business process design and enactment. The quality of the discovered DFAs is assessed wrt customized definitions of fitness, precision, generalization, and a standard notion of DFA simplicity. Finally, we use these metrics to benchmark ML algorithms against real-life and synthetically generated datasets, with the aim of studying their performance and investigate their suitability to be used for the development of BPM tools.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the significant advantages brought to business processes by process mining account for its evolution as a major concern in both industrial and academic research. In particular, increasing attention has been turned to compliance monitoring as a way to identify when a sequence of events deviates from the expected behaviour. As we are entering the IoT era, an increasing variety of smart objects can be introduced in business processes (e.g., tags to track products in a plant, smartphones and badge swiping to draw the activities of customers and employees in a shopping centre, etc.). All these objects produce large volumes of log data in the form of streams, which need to be run-time analysed to extract further knowledge about the underlying business process and to identify unexpected, non-conforming events. Albeit rather straightforward on a small log file, compliance verification techniques may show poor performances when dealing with big data and streams, thus calling for scalable approaches. This work investigates the possibility of spreading the compliance monitoring task over a network of computing nodes, achieving the desired scalability. The monitor is realised through the existing SCIFF framework for compliance checking, which provides a high level logic-based language for expressing the properties to be monitored and nicely supports the partitioning of the monitoring task. The distributed computation is achieved through a MapReduce approach and the adoption of an existing general engine for large scale stream processing. Experimental results show the feasibility of the approach as well as the advantages in performance brought to the compliance monitoring task.},

The purpose is to make process information accessible to various stakeholders, including those who are not familiar with reading and interpreting the complex execution logic of process models. Despite this merit, there is a clear risk that model and text become misaligned when changes are not applied to both descriptions consistently. For organizations with hundreds of different processes, the effort required to identify and clear up such conflicts is considerable. To support organizations in keeping their process descriptions consistent, we present an approach to automatically identify inconsistencies between a process model and a corresponding textual description. Our approach detects cases where the two process representations describe activities in different orders and detect process model activities not contained in the textual description. A quantitative evaluation with 53 real-life model-text pairs demonstrates that our approach accurately identifies inconsistencies between model and text.},

In recent times there has also been an increase in the importance of compliance units involved in the management of compliance risk in the bank. The author in the paper highlights the need to risk monitoring of non-compliance with the regulations and presents some monitoring tools of this kind of risk in the bank. Examples of tools and techniques presented in the paper relate to banks operating in Poland. These are mainly methods based on using indicators, supported by information technology tools for business process management. The scope of compliance evolved last years to a much broader area. The author of the paper draws attention to the growing popularity of the approach integrating operational and compliance risk},

  abstract = {The increase in the amount of information has led to new information constructs in enterprise content management (ECM). ECM is proposed by its proponents as the panacea to the challenges in the current information environment. It focuses on the management of all content in an organization whether it is structured or unstructured. It is claimed that it enables organizations to control their content, boost productivity, promote collaboration, meet with compliance initiatives, promote better content-centric processes, which make information easily accessible and easy to share. ECM is however variably defined as a technology, an initiative, a framework, and skills an organization espouses to manage its information resources effectively. ECM proponents highlight factors such as: enterprise architecture, business process management, change management, collaboration, knowledge management, system integration, repurposing of content, and the life cycle management of content. The challenge organizations face today is how to exercise control over their information resources, which is often in dispersed environments. Such environments often create information silos instead of promoting access. Information can only be regarded as a resource if it can be timely accessed and used. Information in dispersed environments is often crucial to the day-to-day operations of an organization. This information can also be controlled by individuals other than being stored in a common repository where everybody who needs it can access it. Today’s working environment requires that employees access information regardless of where they are in the world. This mobile office environment also requires organizations to put in place information management strategies that can manage information securely and at the same time promote use and accessibility. This chapter explores the concept of ECM.},

  abstract = {The generic model query language GMQL is designed to query collections of conceptual models created in arbitrary graph-based modelling languages. Querying conceptual models means searching for particular model subgraphs that comply with a predefined pattern query. Such a query specifies the structural and semantic properties of the model fragment to be returned. In this paper, we derive requirements for a generic model query language from the literature and formally specify the language’s syntax and semantics. We conduct an analysis of GMQL׳s theoretical and practical runtime performance concluding that it returns query results within satisfactory time. Given its generic nature, GMQL contributes to a broad range of different model analysis scenarios ranging from business process compliance management to model translation and business process weakness detection. As GMQL returns results with acceptable runtime performance, it can be used to query large collections of hundreds or thousands of conceptual models containing not only process models, but also data models or organizational charts. In this paper, we furthermore evaluate GMQL against the backdrop of existing query approaches thereby carving out its advantages and limitations as well as pointing toward future research.},

  abstract = {Organizations are required to comply with changes in legislation and policy. Yet the implementation of new legislation is often expensive, can have long lead times and is prone to failure. The existing situation significantly constrains policy-making. To improve this, policy makers and policy executors are searching for ways to achieve higher levels of flexibility and agility in their business process management systems. Flexibility is the ability to react to changes and agility is the speed in responding to variety and change. Both flexibility and agility are multi-dimensional concepts. This paper presents principles for creating flexibility and agility when implementing new or revised policies into business processes. These principles include: 1) defining and using business services, 2) integrating and orchestrating business services through the use of events, 3) separating process, knowledge and resources and 4) implementing policy in an integrated manner. Business services are components encapsulating business functions and having clear responsibilities and accountabilities. The case study shows that these forms of flexibility and agility can help to implement policies more quickly and cost effectively. An organization's resources and level of flexibility and agility determines what laws can be implemented within a certain time. The improvement of flexibility and agility requires innovations on all levels: infrastructure, business process and organization. The level of flexibility and agility should always be measured by a combination of measures. We make plea for instruments assessing the impact of policies on organizations prior to implementation.},

  abstract = {Business process management has been the driving force of optimization and operational efficiency for companies until now, but the digitalization era we have been experiencing requires businesses to be agile and responsive as well. In order to be a part of this digital transformation, delivering new levels of automation-fueled agility through digitalization of BPM itself is required. However, the automation of BPM cannot be achieved by solely focusing on process space and classical planning techniques. It requires a holistic approach that also captures the social aspects of the business environment, such as corporate strategies, organization policies, negotiations, and cooperation. For this purpose, we combine BPM, knowledge-intensive systems and intelligent agent technologies, and yield one consolidated intelligent business process management framework, namely agileBPM, that governs the entire BPM life-cycle. Accordingly, agileBPM proposes a modeling methodology to semantically capture the business interests, enterprise environment and process space in accordance with the agent-oriented software engineering paradigm. The proposed agent-based process execution environment provides cognitive capabilities (such as goal-driven planning, norm compliance, knowledge-driven actions, and dynamic cooperation) on top of the developed business models to support knowledge workers’ multi-criteria decision making tasks. The context awareness and exception handling capabilities of the proposed approach have been presented with experimental studies. Through comparative evaluations, it is shown that agileBPM is the most comprehensive knowledge-intensive process management solution.},

Ontologies are a formal declarative knowledge representation model. It provides a foundation upon which machine understandable knowledge can be obtained, and as a result, it makes machine intelligence possible. Healthcare systems can adopt these technologies to make them ubiquitous, adaptive, and intelligent, and then serve patients better. This paper presents an ontological knowledge framework that covers healthcare domains that a hospital encompasses—from the medical or administrative tasks, to hospital assets, medical insurances, patient records, drugs, and regulations. Therefore, our ontology makes our vision of personalized healthcare possible by capturing all necessary knowledge for a complex personalized healthcare scenario involving patient care, insurance policies, and drug prescriptions, and compliances. For example, our ontology facilitates a workflow management system to allow users, from physicians to administrative assistants, to manage, even create context-aware new medical workflows and execute them on-the-fly.},

  abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is defined as the process of creation and management of digital replica for building products in a collaborative design set-up. On this basis, BIM as a digital collaboration platform in AECO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation) industry, can be upgraded to assist monitoring, control and improvement of the business processes related to planning, design, construction and operation of building facilities. The main problem in this regard, is the wastage of data related to activities completed by different actors during the project; and subsequently, the lack of analytics to discover latent patterns in collaboration and execution of such processes. The present study aims to enable BIM to capture digital footprints of project actors and create event logs for design authoring phase of building projects. This is done using files in IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) format, archived during the design process. We have developed algorithms to create event logs from such archives, and analyzed the event logs using process mining (i.e. process discovery, conformance checking and bottleneck analysis), to identify measures derived from as-happened processes. BIM managers can implement such measures in monitoring, controlling and re-engineering work processes related to design authoring. Two case studies were completed to validate and verify the products and findings of the research. Our results show that process models discovered/fine-tuned at various resolutions and from different perspectives (including ‘actor-centric’ and ‘phase-centric’ views) can provide a realistic view of the BIM project execution. This includes understanding the structure of collaboration and hand-over of work; evaluation of compliance with the BIM execution plan; and detection of bottlenecks and re-works. While the scope of the study has been limited to design authoring processes, this mindset can be extended to other BIM uses, and other phases (such as construction and operation) of building projects. Given the growing efforts on upgrading BIM to capture and formalize the lifecycle data on the products, processes and actors, this study can strongly support BIM managers with documentation and evaluation of the business processes and workflows in their project teams.},

However, extracting benefits from such technologies depends on many factors. Methods In this study, an extensive literature review is performed to compare e-health and other sectors in terms of the critical success factors in collaborative business process management. Using the dynamic capabilities view as a general theoretical lens, and a process orientation framework for operationalization, these factors are then conceptualized and validated in a cross-sectional study of cases in the Norwegian municipal e-health sector. Results The study contributes to e-health research by identifying the key factors that influence performance. These factors are significantly driven by government policies and regulations. Our findings challenge the assumption that welfare technology networks can be built from the bottom up without government intervention. Regulatory interventions are needed, to obtain process performance metrics and foster viable, long-term business models for the participating institutions. Conclusion The findings have an impact on research and practice, especially in local public management, for predicting and prescribing future development in this context. There are indications of significant gaps in government policies and regulations. Further research should examine whether and how these findings transcend the chosen context.},

  abstract = {Validation of compliance rules against process data is a fundamental functionality for business process management. Over the years, the problem has been addressed for different types of process data, i.e., process models, process event data at runtime, and event logs representing historical execution. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle compliance checking over process logs. These approaches have been based on different data models and storage technologies including relational databases, graph databases, and proprietary formats. Graph-based encoding of event logs is a promising direction that turns several process analytics tasks into queries on the underlying graph. Compliance checking is one class of such analysis tasks. In this paper, we argue that encoding log data as graphs alone is not enough to guarantee efficient processing of queries on this data. Efficiency is important due to the interactive nature of compliance checking. Thus, compliance checking would benefit from sub-linear scanning of the data. Moreover, as more data are added, e.g., new batches of logs arrive, the data size should grow sub-linearly to optimize both the space of storage and time for querying. We propose two encoding methods using graph representation, realized in Neo4J, and show the benefits of these encoding on a special class of queries, namely timed order compliance rules. Compared to a baseline encoding, our experiments show up to 5x speed up in the querying time as well as a 3x reduction in the graph size.},

  abstract = {Business process compliance is a key area of business process management and aims at ensuring that processes obey to compliance constraints such as regulatory constraints or business rules imposed on them. Process compliance can be checked during process design time based on verification of process models and at runtime based on monitoring the compliance states of running process instances. For existing compliance monitoring approaches it remains unclear whether and how compliance violations can be predicted, although predictions are crucial in order to prepare and take countermeasures in time. This work, hence, analyzes existing literature from compliance monitoring as well as predictive process monitoring and provides an updated framework of compliance monitoring functionalities. Moreover, it raises the vision of a comprehensive predictive compliance monitoring system that integrates existing predicate prediction approaches with the idea of employing PPM with different prediction goals such as next activity or remaining time for prediction and subsequent mapping of the prediction results onto the given set of compliance constraints (PCM). For each compliance monitoring functionality we elicit PCM system requirements and assess their coverage by existing approaches. Based on the assessment, open challenges and research directions realizing a comprehensive PCM system are elaborated.},

  abstract = {This work describes a methodological approach to investigate Compliance Management in healthcare based on a BPM perspective, exploring an application in an innovative hospital service. Firstly, we present a business process analysis by modeling the process with the adoption of a standard language. Secondly, we encode a set of rules in LegalRuleML, an XML formalism designed to be a standard for representing the semantic and logical content of legal documents. The rules represent some provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that are involved in the health process analyzed. Moreover, in order to perform the regulatory compliance check automatically, we converted the set of rules into Defeasible Deontic Logic format (DDL), readable by the Regorous compliance checker developed at CSIRO. Overall, the paper shows a methodology to automate regulatory compliance checking of a real hospital process with actual regulations and norms. The codes in the LegalRuleML and DDL formats used in the work are available online.},

  abstract = {Business Process Compliance (BPC) means  ensuring that business processes are in accordance with relevant  compliance requirements. Thus, BPC is an essential  part  of  both  business  process  management  (BPM)  and  compliance management (CM).  Digitization has also been referred  to as a “digital revolution” that describes  a technological  change  that  has  extended  to  many  organi- zational  areas  and  tasks,  including  compliance. Current  efforts  to  digitize, e.g., by realizing  cyber-physical systems,  rely  on  the  automation  and  interoperability  of  systems. In order  for  CM  not  to  hamper  these efforts,  it  becomes  an  increasingly relevant issue  to  digitize  compliance as well. The managerial perspective of compliance comprises several phases, which together represent a CM life-cycle. Efforts to digitize compliance require bundling interoperable BPC technologies, methods, and tools supporting this life-cycle in a consolidated manner. Several approaches addressing the field of BPC have already been developed and explored. Based on a systematic literature review, we examined these approaches in terms of their suitability for supporting the CM life-cycle phases in support of the digitization of compliance. The results of our literature review show which CM life-cycle phases are supported by BPC approaches and which phases are the focus of research. Moreover, the results show that a purely sequential clustering, as specified in a CM life-cycle, is not always suitable for the bundling of BPC approaches in support of the digitization of compliance. Consequently, we propose a novel, task-oriented clustering of BPC approaches that is particularly oriented toward interoperability.},

By **compliance** in the paper we mean compliance to legislation, **regulations** of municipalities, external regulatory requirements and also internal organisational policies. The goal of the research is (1) to identify main attributes of business process modelling tools relevant in compliance management, and (2) to use the identified attributes for analysis of the tools to better understand the scope of their capability to support compliance management. The attributes of the tools have been derived from the related research. The analysis of the tools has been performed by installing each tool and evaluating it against a set of the identified attributes. The obtained results are useful in choosing the tools for compliance management in general and for open source solutions to develop new compliance management tools in particular.},

Aligning control objectives that stem from regulations and legislation with business objectives devised for improved business performance is a foremost challenge. The organizational as well as IT structures for the two classes of objectives are often distinct and potentially in conflict. In this chapter, we present an overarching methodology for aligning business and control objectives. The various phases of the methodology are then used as a basis for discussing state-of-the-art in compliance management. Contributions from research and academia as well as industry solutions are discussed. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the role of BPM as a driver for regulatory compliance and a presentation of open questions and challenges.},

  abstract = {Compliance specifications concisely describe selected aspects of what a business operation should adhere to. To enable automated techniques for compliance checking, it is important that these requirements are specified correctly and precisely, describing exactly the behavior intended. Although there are rigorous mathematical formalisms for representing compliance rules, these are often perceived to be difficult to use for business users. Regardless of notation, however, there are often subtle but important details in compliance requirements that need to be considered. The main challenge in compliance checking is to bridge the gap between informal description and a precise specification of all requirements. In this paper, we present an approach which aims to facilitate creating and understanding formal compliance requirements by providing configurable templates that capture these details as options for commonly-required compliance requirements. These options are configured interactively with end-users, using question trees and natural language. The approach is implemented in the Process Mining Toolkit ProM.},

  abstract = {Companies develop process models to explicitly describe their business operations. In the same time, business operations, business processes, must adhere to various types of compliance requirements. **Regulations**, e.g., Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, internal policies, best practices are just a few sources of compliance requirements. In some cases, non-adherence to compliance requirements makes the organization subject to legal punishment. In other cases, non-adherence to compliance leads to loss of competitive advantage and thus loss of market share. Unlike the classical domain-independent behavioral correctness of business processes, compliance requirements are domain-specific. Moreover, compliance requirements change over time. New requirements might appear due to change in laws and adoption of new policies. Compliance requirements are offered or enforced by different entities that have different objectives behind these requirements. Finally, compliance requirements might affect different aspects of business processes, e.g., control flow and data flow. As a result, it is infeasible to hard-code compliance checks in tools. Rather, a repeatable process of modeling compliance rules and checking them against business processes automatically is needed. This thesis provides a formal approach to support process design-time compliance checking. Using visual patterns, it is possible to model compliance requirements concerning control flow, data flow and conditional flow rules. Each pattern is mapped into a temporal logic formula. The thesis addresses the problem of consistency checking among various compliance requirements, as they might stem from divergent sources. Also, the thesis contributes to automatically check compliance requirements against process models using model checking. We show that extra domain knowledge, other than expressed in compliance rules, is needed to reach correct decisions. In case of violations, we are able to provide a useful feedback to the user. The feedback is in the form of parts of the process model whose execution causes the violation. In some cases, our approach is capable of providing automated remedy of the violation.},

  abstract = {Process Mining is a branch of Data Science that aims to extract process-related information from event data contained in information systems, that is steadily increasing in amount. Many algorithms, and a general-purpose open source framework (ProM 6), have been developed in the last years for process discovery, conformance checking, machine learning on event data. However, in very few cases scalability has been a target, prioritizing the quality of the output over the execution speed and the optimization of resources. This is making progressively more difficult to apply process mining with mainstream workstations on reallife event data with any open source process mining framework. Hence, exploring more scalable storage techniques, in-memory data structures, more performant algorithms is a strictly incumbent need. In this paper, we propose the usage of mainstream columnar storages and dataframes to increase the scalability of process mining. These can replace the classic event log structures in most tasks, but require completely different implementations with regards to mainstream process mining algorithms. Dataframes will be defined, some algorithms on such structures will be presented and their complexity will be calculated.},

  abstract = {Blockchain-based smart contracts have triggered polarised discussions. They have been applauded as a significant technological achievement, but also criticised as a dumb idea. Their application is rapidly expanding in the financial sector, public sector, supply chain management, and the automobile, real estate, insurance, and health care industries. With the growing use of smart contracts and an increasing variety of smart contracts applications, the debate over the legal implications of this phenomenon has intensified and many legal issues related to smart contracts are being examined. Legal scholars have highlighted potential legal pitfalls, controversies and incompatibilities with existing legal frameworks. Blockchain technology and smart contracts have also been fuelling an interest of legislators, who have begun to recognise regulatory uncertainties and are making the first attempts to introduce legislative solutions to address them. This paper aims to highlight the fervour of the scholarly debate surrounding smart contracts and contrast it with a rather modest response from the legislators thus far. The paper reiterates that smart contracts represent the future. Even though they challenge practitioners, scholars, and legislators, current legislative initiatives indicate that under most legal systems there are no major obstacles for smart contracts and to accommodate smart contracts within the existing legal frameworks we should expect legal evolution rather than revolution.},

The impression arose that certain quality issues originated from cognitive failures during the modeling process. Therefore, we developed an explanatory theory that describes the cognitive mechanisms that affect effectiveness and efficiency of process model construction: the Structured Process Modeling Theory (SPMT). This theory states that modeling accuracy and speed are higher when the modeler adopts an (i) individually fitting (ii) structured (iii) serialized process modeling approach. The SPMT is evaluated against six theory quality criteria.},

  abstract = {Process models constitute crucial artifacts in modern information systems, and their proper comprehension is of utmost importance in utilizing such systems. Generally, process models are considered from two different perspectives: process modelers and readers. Both perspectives share similarities and differences in the comprehension of process models (e.g., diverse experiences when working with process models). The literature proposed many rules and guidelines to ensure proper comprehension of process models for both perspectives. As a novel contribution in this context, this paper introduces the process model comprehension framework (PMCF), constituting a first approach towards the measurement and quantification of the perspectives of process modelers and readers, as well as the interaction of both regarding the comprehension of process models. Therefore, the PMCF describes an Evaluation theory tree based on the communication theory and the conceptual modeling quality framework and considers a total of 96 quality metrics to quantify process model comprehension. Furthermore, the PMCF was evaluated in a survey with 131 participants and has been implemented and applied successfully in a practical case study including 33 participants. To conclude, the PMCF allows for the identification of pitfalls and provides related information about how to assist process modelers and readers in fostering and enabling a proper comprehension of process models.},

  abstract = {Regulatory compliance of business operations is a critical problem for enterprises. As enterprises increasingly use business process management systems to automate their business processes, technologies to automatically check the compliance of process models against compliance rules are becoming important. In this paper, we present a method to improve the reliability and minimize the risk of failure of business process management systems from a compliance perspective. The proposed method allows separate modeling of both process models and compliance concerns. Business process models expressed in the Business Process Execution Language are transformed into pi-calculus and then into finite state machines. Compliance rules captured in the graphical Business Property Specification Language are translated into linear temporal logic. Thus, process models can be verified against these compliance rules by means of model-checking technology. The benefit of our method is threefold: Through the automated verification of a large set of business process models, our approach increases deployment efficiency and lowers the risk of installing noncompliant processes; it reduces the cost associated with inspecting business process models for compliance; and compliance checking may ensure compliance of new process models before their execution and thereby increase the reliability of business operations in general.

In the development of this work, it was found, through a state-of-art study, that there are no proposals contemplating the solution of this problem in its totality. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper it is presented a model for Information Technology management constituted by COBIT, ITIL and BPM management good practices, together with SOA and XBRL Technologies. This model is composed by 03 layers that aim at structuring the organization IT and business processes, besides defining a process for implementing SOA and integrating its Web services with XBRL language. One can expect this work to contribute to companies to decrease the negative impact coming from the lack of conformity with laws and regulations, through the creation of a corporative and IT environment that is flexible and more adaptable to changes, which may occur in legal demands, as well as improving the quality and reliability of financial report issuance.},

We show that streamlining regulatory compliance using multiple purposive models of various aspects of regulations, it is possible to leverage both the rigor of formal techniques and the holistic enterprise GRC perspective. Our contributions are twofold. First, we present a model-driven architecture based on a conceptual model of integrated GRC that is capable of addressing key challenges of regulatory compliance. Second, using Know Your Customer regulations in Indian context as a case study, we demonstrate the utility of this architecture.

  abstract = {Blockchain technology (BCT) has brought a paradigm shift to Business Process Management (BPM). BCT provides a trusted decentralized infrastructure to secure data and process executions using distributed ledgers and smart contract to manage complex business processes. Numerous efforts have been made to exploit BCT in supporting dynamic and trusted collaborations of business processes. This paper aims to understand recent BCT development for its BPM applications and identify the limitations and challenges for further development via a systematic literature review (SLR). It is found that numerous works have reported using BCT as technical solutions to fulfill some traditional BPM functions. This paper is distinguished from existing works, especially several relevant surveys in the sense that (1) the impact of using BCT in BPM is thoroughly explored to identify new constraints and challenges explicitly brought by blockchains; (2) the requirements for Business Process Compliance (BPC) are firstly analyzed in detail. Note that BPC is to assure the adherence of business processes to pre-defined policies, standards, specifications, regulations, and laws when business processes are executed. To fill the gaps of BCT applications in these two aspects, Blockchain-as-aService (BCaaS) is adopted in business process architecture, and the trends of BCT developments are identified accordingly.},

  abstract = {Process models constitute valuable artifacts for organizations. A process model formally captures the way an organization works internally and interacts with its customers and partners. Over time, more models may be created as business practices evolve (leading to different versions of models) or an organization expands, e.g., through mergers or acquisitions. It is not uncommon for large organizations to have to manage thousands of process models. Retrieval of process models with desired properties then poses a significant challenge, particularly when one is concerned with finding models that describe certain process scenarios, i.e., sequences of tasks captured in models. This paper proposes a method for automated process model retrieval based on scenario compatibility. A process model is retrieved if it has the potential to perform the specified process scenario. To allow for scenarios to be underspecified, wildcards may be used in their description. The paper reports on a formal language for scenario-based process querying, its implementation, and evaluation in the context of industrial and synthetic process models. The results show that the technique works in (close to) real time.},

  abstract = {Today’s enterprises demand a high degree of compliance of business processes to meet diverse regulations and legislations. Several industrial studies have shown that compliance management is a daunting task, and organizations are still struggling and spending billions of dollars annually to ensure and prove their compliance. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive compliance management framework with a main focus on design-time compliance management as a first step towards a preventive lifetime compliance support. The framework enables the automation of compliance related-activities that are amenable to automation, and therefore can significantly reduce the expenditures spent on compliance. It can help experts to carry out their work more efficiently, cut the time spent on tedious manual activities, and reduce potential human errors. An evident candidate compliance activity for automation is the compliance checking, which can be achieved by utilizing formal reasoning and verification techniques. However, formal languages are well-known of their complexity as only versed users in mathematical theories and formal logics are able to use and understand them. However, this is generally not the case with business and compliance practitioners. Therefore, in the heart of the compliance management framework, we introduce the Compliance Request Language (CRL), which is formally grounded on temporal logic and enables the abstract pattern-based specification of compliance requirements. CRL constitutes a series of compliance patterns that spans three structural facets of business processes; control-flow, employed resources and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, CRL supports the specification of compensations and nonmonotonic requirements, which permit the relaxation of some compliance requirements to handle exceptional situations. An integrated tool-suite has been developed as an instantiation artefact and the validation of the approach is undertaken in several directions, which includes internal validity, controlled experiments and functional testing.},

  abstract = {Law at large underpins modern society, codifying and governing many aspects of citizens' daily lives. Oftentimes, law is subject to interpretation, debate and challenges throughout various courts and jurisdictions. But in some other areas, law leaves little room for interpretation, and essentially aims to rigorously describe a computation, a decision procedure or, simply said, an algorithm. Unfortunately, prose remains a woefully inadequate tool for the job. The lack of formalism leaves room for ambiguities; the structure of legal statutes, with many paragraphs and sub-sections spread across multiple pages, makes it hard to compute the intended outcome of the algorithm underlying a given text; and, as with any other piece of poorly-specified critical software, the use of informal language leaves corner cases unaddressed. We introduce Catala, a new programming language that we specifically designed to allow a straightforward and systematic translation of statutory law into an executable implementation. Catala aims to bring together lawyers and programmers through a shared medium, which together they can understand, edit and evolve, bridging a gap that often results in dramatically incorrect implementations of the law. We have implemented a compiler for Catala, and have proven the correctness of its core compilation steps using the F* proof assistant. We evaluate Catala on several legal texts that are algorithms in disguise, notably section 121 of the US federal income tax and the byzantine French family benefits; in doing so, we uncover a bug in the official implementation. We observe as a consequence of the formalization process that using Catala enables rich interactions between lawyers and programmers, leading to a greater understanding of the original legislative intent, while producing a correct-by-construction executable specification reusable by the greater software ecosystem.},

Workflow management systems are systems that use detailed process models to drive the business processes. Current business process modelling languages and models are of imperative nature – they strictly prescribe how to work. Systems that allow users to maneuver within the process model or even change the model while working are considered to be the most suitable for dynamic processes management. However, in many companies it is not realistic to expect that end-users are able to change their processes. Moreover, the imperative nature of these languages forces designer to over-specify processes, which results in frequent changes. We propose a fundamental paradigm shift for flexible process management and propose a more declarative approach. Declarative models specify what should be done without specifying how it should be done. We propose the ConDec language for modelling and enacting dynamic business processes. ConDec is based on temporal logic rather than some imperative process modelling language.},

  abstract = {Risk management is a central business process in many organizations and enterprise activities, and has been defined and elaborated as such in various standards and studies. Consideration of risk and risk management activities as part of business processes is becoming increasingly critical for successful process execution. Risk management extends uncertainty management by accounting for the adverse effects of uncertain events and their potential damages to business objectives if they occur. Hazards, business risks, and regulation mandate that risk be considered as an integral part of most business processes. The integration of risk into business process models, rendering them “risk-aware”, requires deep understanding of the nature of risk and the semantics and methodology to capture it in conceptual models. Extraction of risk-related insights from process models contributes to improving design and configuration of business processes, enabling them to better cope with risks and threats. In this paper we review and summarize the literature on integration of risk management and business process management, propose ontology for this interdisciplinary domain, and identify knowledge gaps requiring additional research.},

  abstract = {Compliance in business processes has become a fundamental requirement given the constant rise in regulatory requirements and competitive pressures that have emerged in recent decades. While in other areas of business process modelling and execution, considerable progress towards automation has been made (e.g., process discovery, executable process models), the interpretation and implementation of compliance requirements is still a highly complex task requiring human effort and time. To increase the level of “mechanization” when implementing regulations in business processes, compliance research seeks to formalize compliance requirements. Formal representations of compliance requirements should, then, be leveraged to design correct process models and, ideally, would also serve for the automated detection of violations. To formally specify compliance requirements, however, multiple process perspectives, such as control flow, data, time and resources, have to be considered. This leads to the challenge of representing such complex constraints which affect different process perspectives. To this end, current approaches in business process compliance make use of a varied set of languages. However, every approach has been devised based on different assumptions and motivating scenarios. In addition, these languages and their presentation usually abstract from real-world requirements which often would imply introducing a substantial amount of domain knowledge and interpretation, thus hampering the evaluation of their expressiveness. This is a serious problem, since comparisons of different formal languages based on real-world compliance requirements are lacking, meaning that users of such languages are not able to make informed decisions about which language to choose. To close this gap and to establish a uniform evaluation basis, we introduce a running example for evaluating the expressiveness and complexity of compliance rule languages. For language selection, we conducted a literature review. Next, we briefly introduce and demonstrate the languages’ grammars and vocabularies based on the representation of a number of legal requirements. In doing so, we pay attention to semantic subtleties which we evaluate by adopting a normative classification framework which differentiates between different deontic assignments. Finally, on top of that, we apply Halstead’s well-known metrics for calculating the relevant characteristics of the different languages in our comparison, such as the volume, difficulty and effort for each language. With this, we are finally able to better understand the lexical complexity of the languages in relation to their expressiveness. In sum, we provide a systematic comparison of different compliance rule languages based on real-world compliance requirements which may inform future users and developers of these languages. Finally, we advocate for a more user-aware development of compliance languages which should consider a trade off between expressiveness, complexity and usability.},

To support compliance-related activities, a plethora of compliance management frameworks (CMFs), compliance languages and systems have emerged, which is on one hand advantageous, but may cause confusion when deciding which CMF can be used to best fulfil the organisation’s internal requirements. This is due to the lack of acceptable compliance tools and methodologies in the compliance domain to uncover and compare the multidimensionality of capability between different frameworks and users’ needs, which give raise to the question of how to formally evaluate a CMF. In this paper, we propose methodologies to formally evaluate CMFs, compliance languages and systems, in particular the underlying formal language of a CMF; and present the formal evaluation of two prominent formal language-based CMFs, namely, PENELOPE and PCL, with a business contract using formal analysis approach. Our evaluations formally validate that the proposed methodologies are instrumental in deciding on the suitability of a CMF when is comes to evaluating the underlying formal logic of the framework to represent different types of norms.},

A principal goal of the model-driven development is the improved transparency of processes and the alignment of process diagrams and technical code. First experiences of using the business process model and notation (BPMN) show that easy-to-read graphical process models can achieve and provide standardization of laboratory workflows. The model-based development allows one to change processes quickly and an easy adaption to changing requirements. The process models are able to host work procedures and their scheduling in compliance with predefined guidelines and policies. Finally, the process-controlled documentation of complex workflow results addresses modern laboratory needs of quality assurance. BPMN 2.0 as an automation language to control every kind of activity or subprocess is directed to complete workflows in end-to-end relationships. BPMN is applicable as a system-independent and cross-disciplinary graphical language to document all methods in laboratories (i.e., screening procedures or analytical processes). That means, with the BPM standard, a communication method of sharing process knowledge of laboratories is also available.},

  abstract = {Business process management (BPM) aims to optimize business processes to achieve better system performance such as higher profit, quicker response, and better services. BPM systems in Industry 4.0 are required to digitize and automate business process workflows and support the transparent interoperations of service vendors. The critical bottleneck to advance BPM systems is the evaluation, verification, and transformation of trustworthiness and digitized assets. Most of BPM systems rely heavily on domain experts or third parties to deal with trustworthiness. In this paper, an automated BPM solution is investigated to select and compose services in open business environment, Blockchain technology (BCT) is explored and proposed to transfer and verify the trustiness of businesses and partners, and a BPM framework is developed to illustrate how BCT can be integrated to support prompt, reliable, and cost-effective evaluation and transferring of Quality of Services in the workflow composition and management.},

Adopting a process-based perspective, the authors propose a formal methodology to increase ICSs aims, related to the segregation of duties (SoDs) models, efficiently and effectively. Design/methodology/approach The authors examine the applicability of formal verifications to validate a banking process of providing investment services, which is mapped through the workflow management system. To mitigate the state explosion problem of formal methods, the authors propose an efficient methodology that has been proved on the SoDs models in the bank ICSs, as a case study. Findings The authors’ investigations suggest that in the BPM domain, the banking ICSs aims can benefit from the aforesaid methodologies, originating from the formal methods area, to increase the reliability and correctness in the design, modelling and implementation of the SoDs models. Originality/value The proposed methodology is quite general and can be efficiently applied to large-scale systems in different business contexts or areas of the BPM. Its application to the bank's SoD prevents or detects significant weaknesses, operational risks, excessive risk appetite and other undesirable behaviours in the investment services provision processes. This guarantees that the investment ordered/offered is “suitable and appropriate” with the client's risk profile, especially non-professional, required by the MiFID II Directive.},

  abstract = {The production and storage of dangerous substances in an industrial establishment creates risks for man, environment and properties in the surrounding area. Safety regulations require the establishment of a preventive information campaign regarding industrial risks and self-defence measures to adopt in an emergency situation. In the case of a major accident, people must be promptly made aware of the appropriate self-defence actions and behaviours to adopt. This strategic activity can reduce the panic effect, make citizens more cooperative and guarantee the effectiveness of any emergency plan. In this paper, the information chain is studied as an industrial process modelled by the IDEF0 language. Through this method, each link in the chain has been deeply analysed. For each function of the process, the inputs, outputs and necessary controls and resources have been identified. Starting from a clear view of the current state, the process of re-engineering has been implemented to minimise or eliminate downtime, deficiencies and illnesses and, thus, consequent time losses. The main contribution of the IDEF0 application in emergency management is to provide a clear view of the whole system, a communication system between emergency actors, a rich information source and a structured base for the re-engineering process.},

To ensure continuous guaranteed compliance, compliance management should be considered during all phases of the business process lifecycle; from the analysis and design to deployment, monitoring and evaluation. This paper introduces an integrated business process compliance management framework that incorporates design-time verification and runtime monitoring approaches. The nutshell of the approach is the Compliance Request Language (CRL), which is a high-level pattern-based language for the abstract specification of compliance requirements. From CRL expressions, formal compliance rules can be automatically generated, thereby eliminating the need for business and compliance experts to learn and use complex low-level formal languages. Formalized compliance rules enable automated approaches to be used for the static verification and dynamic monitoring of business processes. An integrated prototypical tool-suite is developed as a proof-of-concept to help validating the applicability of the approaches, and validated by experiment with two real-life case studies.},

One of the most crucial tasks of BPM is discovering and modelling business processes from text documents.

We created a new dataset and three models solve this problem. Our best model achieved very promising results of 83.82, 87.84, and 85.75 for Precision, Recall, and F1, respectively, for extracting Condition, Action, and Consequence clauses using Exact Match metric.},

Software systems of such distinct organizations should support these larger processes and, for this, they need to communicate among them forming the so called Systems-of-Systems (SoS). However, the management of these larger processes and the correspondent SoS has been currently a complicated challenge for the alliances of organizations. In this scenario, the main contribution of this paper is to discover what has been proposed in the literature to manage these processes. We analyzed possibly all existing approaches and the findings point out that many of them cannot provide understanding of the whole large processes and, more importantly, they do not address completely the SoS inherent characteristics. We also highlight the next research directions to make possible the management of these dynamic, complex, interconnected business processes that have increasingly crossed several critical domains.},

It is of primary interest to obtain the stationary flow on such a directed graph, which corresponds to the steady-state of a firm during the business process. Following the ideas developed recently for the World Wide Web, we construct the Google matrix for our business process model and analyze its spectral properties. The importance of nodes is characterized by PageRank and recently proposed CheiRank and 2DRank, respectively. The results show that this two-dimensional ranking gives a significant information about the influence and communication properties of business model units.

We evaluate each regarding suitability for accuracy, modification, analysis, and transfer. We consider the degree of training and technical sophistication required to utilize each design. The data-driven design provides insight into poor spreadsheet practices by naïve modelers. The technical design can be modified for new data and new structural elements without manual writing or editing of cell formulas, thus speeding modification and reducing risk of error. The technical design has potential for use with other classes of models. We identify opportunities for future research.},

  abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) needs to be adjusted quickly and flexibly to cope with the dynamics of the business environment, so the demand for the incorporation of agility has reached BPM. To contribute to the theoretical consolidation of Agile BPM, it is necessary to develop a conceptualization for the term, that is, to describe the essential attributes for its understanding. Communicating the meaning of the concept in reduced words occurs through the definition, so the main objective of this study is to develop a scientific definition for Agile BPM. This study was performed in three phases. First, a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate how the scientific literature has addressed Agile BPM. Next, a deductive analysis was performed to conceptualize Agile BPM. In the third phase, a consultation with experts was conducted to refine the conceptual view and critique a tentative definition, preceded by judges' analysis to consolidate the definition. As a result, the concept of Agile BPM was elaborated, and based on the reduction of this conceptualization, a scientific definition was presented which describes that Agile BPM is “the promotion of BPM in which practitioners stimulate change quickly and flexibly in order to meet organizational demands with compliance and provide a better customer experience”. There is a pioneering spirit in the present study regarding the deliberate conceptualization of Agile BPM, which provides the basis for discussion of the topic, and helps scientific dissemination through a definition, contributing to the development of a theory of Agile BPM.},

  abstract = {Background: Systematic reviews are vital to the pursuit of evidence-based medicine within healthcare. Screening titles and abstracts (T\&Ab) for inclusion in a systematic review is an intensive, and often collaborative, step. The use of appropriate tools is therefore important. In this study, we identified and evaluated the usability of software tools that support T\&Ab screening for systematic reviews within healthcare research. Methods: We identified software tools using three search methods: a web-based search; a search of the online “systematic review toolbox”; and screening of references in existing literature. We included tools that were accessible and available for testing at the time of the study (December 2018), do not require specific computing infrastructure and provide basic screening functionality for systematic reviews. Key properties of each software tool were identified using a feature analysis adapted for this purpose. This analysis included a weighting developed by a group of medical researchers, therefore prioritising the most relevant features. The highest scoring tools from the feature analysis were then included in a user survey, in which we further investigated the suitability of the tools for supporting T\&Ab screening amongst systematic reviewers working in medical research. Results: Fifteen tools met our inclusion criteria. They vary significantly in relation to cost, scope and intended user community. Six of the identified tools (Abstrackr, Colandr, Covidence, DRAGON, EPPI-Reviewer and Rayyan) scored higher than 75\% in the feature analysis and were included in the user survey. Of these, Covidence and Rayyan were the most popular with the survey respondents. Their usability scored highly across a range of metrics, with all surveyed researchers (n = 6) stating that they would be likely (or very likely) to use these tools in the future. Conclusions: Based on this study, we would recommend Covidence and Rayyan to systematic reviewers looking for suitable and easy to use tools to support T\&Ab screening within healthcare research. These two tools consistently demonstrated good alignment with user requirements. We acknowledge, however, the role of some of the other tools we considered in providing more specialist features that may be of great importance to many researchers.},

  abstract = {Companies have to adhere to compliance requirements. Typically, both, business experts and compliance experts, are involved in compliance analysis of business operations. Hence, these experts need a common understanding of the business processes for effective compliance management. In this paper, we argue that process templates generated out of compliance requirements can be used as a basis for negotiation among business and compliance experts. We introduce a semi automated approach to synthesize process templates out of compliance requirements expressed in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). As part of that, we show how general constraints related to business process execution are incorporated. Building upon existing work on process mining algorithms, our approach to synthesize process templates considers not only control-flow, but also data-flow dependencies. Finally, we elaborate on the application of the derived process templates and present an implementation of our approach.},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of a compliance management framework (CMF) can be guaranteed only if the framework is based on sound conceptual and formal foundations. In particular, the formal language used in the CMF is able to expressively represent the specifications of normative requirements (hereafter, norms) that impose constraints on various activities of a business process. However, if the language used lacks expressiveness and the modelling constructs proposed in the CMF are not able to properly represent different types of norms, it can significantly impede the reliability of the compliance results produced by the CMF. This paper investigates whether existing CMFs are able to provide reasoning and modeling support for various types of normative requirements by evaluating the conceptual foundations of the modeling constructs that existing CMFs use to represent a specific type of norm. The evaluation results portray somewhat a bleak picture of the state-of-the-affairs when it comes to represent norms as none of the existing CMFs is able to provide a comprehensive reasoning and modeling support. Also, it points to the shortcomings of the CMFs and emphasises exigent need of new modeling languages with sound theoretical and formal foundations for representing legal norms.},

Here, we present                     pyResearchInsights                     , a novel open‐source automated content analysis package that can be used to analyze scientific abstracts within a natural language processing framework.                                                                        The package collects abstracts from scientific repositories, identifies topics of research discussed in these abstracts, and presents interactive concept maps to visualize these research topics. To showcase the utilities of this package, we present two examples, specific to the field of ecology and conservation biology.                                                     First, we demonstrate the end‐to‐end functionality of the package by presenting topics of research discussed in 1,131 abstracts pertaining to birds of the Tropical Andes. Our results suggest that a large proportion of avian research in this biodiversity hotspot pertains to species distributions, climate change, and plant ecology.                                                     Second, we retrieved and analyzed 22,561 abstracts across eight journals in the field of conservation biology to identify twelve global topics of conservation research. Our analysis shows that conservation policy and landscape ecology are focal topics of research. We further examined how these conservation‐associated research topics varied across five biodiversity hotspots.                                                     Lastly, we compared the utilities of this package with existing tools that carry out automated content analysis, and we show that our open‐source package has wider functionality and provides end‐to‐end utilities that seldom exist across other tools.},

Sites such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and Scopus leverage it to show and compare the impact of authors. The h-index can be described in simple terms: it is the highest h for which an authors has h papers with the number of cites more or equal than h. Unfortunately, some researchers, in order to increase their productivity artificially, manipulate their h-index using different techniques such as self-citation. Even though it is relatively simple to discard self-citations, every day appears more sophisticated methods to artificially increase this index. One of these methods is collaborative citations, in which a researcher A cites indiscriminately another researcher B, with whom it has a previous collaboration, increasing her/his h-index. This work presents a new robust generalization of the h-index called rh-index that minimizes the impact of new collaborative citations, maintaining the importance of their citations previous to their collaborative work. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed index, we analyze its effect over 600 Chilean researchers. Our results show that, while some of the most cited researchers were barely affected, demonstrating their robustness, another group of authors show a substantial reduction in comparison to their original h-index.},

This paper compares and contrasts the process roles demanded by industry with the backgrounds of BPM professionals. We perform a content analysis of advertised job positions in order to compare the skill sets demanded by industry with those found in an extensive study of BPM practitioner profiles. Our findings suggest several discrete roles: Chief Process Officer, Process Owner, Process Architect, Process Consultant, and Process Analyst. We find that while consultants and analysts are the most sought-after positions, they also represent the largest pool of available BPM professionals on the market. Roles that indicate a higher level of maturity such as Process Architects are solicited much less frequently, but are used by job seekers as advertising labels. We find Chief Process Officers to be a desirable role from an organizational maturity perspective, but also the rarest and highest qualified role on the supply side. Our findings provide initial insight for BPM education programs and potential BPM career trajectories.},

Commonly, compliance is handled by separate organizational units and not well integrated with core business processes. Based on the area of information systems (IS) controls as mechanism to fulfil given requirements, this paper proposes a concept to bridge this gap between regulatory compliance and business process management. The presented concept enables linking process models with internal control systems and provides a common language for all parties involved. An approach is developed to identify and extract reusable control elements for regulatory compliance from real-world process specifications. These artefacts are formalized as “Control Patterns” (CPs). Inductive analysis methods are employed to identify reusable patterns. As a proof of concept, based on a sample of proven implementations of the software change management process, the paper analyses possibilities to extract, generalize and explicitly model IS controls.},

The recycling of contaminated metal waste in the UK is not well established, with the majority of waste disposed of at the Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR) at Drigg. This paper presents an overview of the Strategic BPEO study completed by Studsvik examining the options for low level metal waste management and a subsequent BPM study completed in support of a proposed metals recycling service. The environmental benefits of recycling metals overseas is further examined through the application of lifecycle analysis to the metals recycling process. The methodologies used for both studies are discussed and the findings of these studies presented. These indicate that recycling contaminated metal is the preferred option, using overseas facilities until UK facilities are available. The BPM for metals recycling is discussed in detail and indicates that a tool box for processing metal waste is required to ensure BPM is applied on a case by case basis. This is supported by effective management of waste transport and waste acceptance criteria. Whilst the transport of contaminated metal overseas for treatment adds to the environmental burden of metals recycling, this when compared with the production of virgin metal, is shown to remain beneficial. The results of the Studsvik studies demonstrate the benefits of recycling metals, the options available for such a service and challenges that remain.},

  abstract = {Because of the competitive economy, organizations today seek to rationalize, innovate, and adapt to changing environments and circumstances as part of business process improvement efforts. The strength of blockchain technology lies in its usage as an apt technology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes; furthermore, it prevents the use of erroneous or obsolete data and allows sharing of confidential data securely. The use of superior technology in the execution and automation of business processes brings opportunities to rethink the specific process itself as well. Business processes modeling and verification are essential to control and assure organizational evolution, therefore, the aim of this paper is three-fold: firstly, to provide business process management patterns in finance, based on blockchain, specifically for the loan-application process in the banking industry and claim process in the insurance industry that could be used and customized by companies; secondly, to critically analyze challenges and opportunities from the introduction of such approach for companies, and thirdly, to outline how companies can implement the loan business process as a web service. Partner companies (a bank and an insurance company) formulated the potential requirements for M2P along with the application of blockchain technology. An experimental design framework was established that gave the necessary services to model the requirements, check the models, and operationalize the models. The applied research methodologies are as follows: design science research paradigm and software case study, model-to-programming (M2P) of business processes, and utilization of patterns of workflow and blockchain.},

  abstract = {Cloud Business Process Management (BPM) platforms, such as Appian, have gained significant traction in recent years due to their ability to streamline and automate business processes. One key feature that has revolutionized process automation is Robotic Process Automation (RPA). RPA enables the creation of software robots that mimic human actions and interact with various applications, systems, and data sources to perform repetitive and rule-based tasks.This abstract focuses on the RPA capabilities within the Appian platform and its impact on business process automation. Appian's RPA capabilities provide organizations with the ability to integrate and orchestrate human-centric and robot-centric tasks within their business processes, resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy, and productivity.By leveraging Appian's RPA capabilities, organizations can automate manual, time-consuming tasks, such as data entry, data validation, and data extraction, by creating software robots that execute these tasks with speed and precision. The platform offers a user-friendly interface for designing, deploying, and managing software robots, enabling both technical and non-technical users to participate in the automation journey. Appian’s RPA capabilities also facilitate seamless integration with existing systems and applications, allowing organizations to leverage their investments in legacy systems while enhancing their automation capabilities. Through APIs and connectors, software robots can interact with databases, web services, enterprise applications, and other sources of data, enabling end-to-end process automation. Additionally, the Appian platform provides comprehensive monitoring, reporting, and analytics capabilities for RPA. Organizations can track and measure the performance of software robots, identify bottlenecks, and gain insights into process efficiency and effectiveness. This data-driven approach allows for continuous improvement and optimization of automated processes. Furthermore, the cloud-based nature of the Appian platform offers scalability, flexibility, and accessibility. Organizations can rapidly scale their RPA deployments based on business needs, leverage cloud resources for increased computing power, and enable access to software robots from any device and location. In conclusion, Appian's RPA capabilities within the Cloud BPM application offer organizations the opportunity to achieve significant advancements in process automation. By leveraging software robots to perform repetitive tasks, organizations can enhance operational efficiency, reduce errors, and allocate resources to more value-added activities. The abstract highlights the key features and benefits of Appian's RPA capabilities, setting the stage for further exploration and understanding of how this technology can revolutionize business process management.},

  abstract = {Business process management (BPM) research emphasises three important logics – modelling (process), infrastructural alignment (infrastructure) and procedural actor (agency) logics. These logics capture the dominant ways of thinking in BPM, reflected in its assumptions, practices and values. While the three logics have proven useful in prior contexts, we argue that the applicability of these underlying assumptions in theorising BPM needs to be re-examined in the context of digital transformation. Based on an ethnographic study of BPM in a company undergoing digital transformation, we uncover tensions related to applying these prior logics that point to the need to update the underlying assumptions. Consequently, we propose new logics that we conceptualise as light touch processes (process), infrastructural flexibility (infrastructure) and mindful actors (agency). Our observations contribute to a rethinking of the dominant BPM logics by unpacking their dynamics in the context of digital transformation. Our study further highlight salient differences between digital transformation and IT-enabled organisational transformation contexts. We conclude by proposing new managerial approaches for BPM in digital transformation contexts.},

  abstract = {Context and motivation] Requirements formalisation facilitates reasoning about inconsistencies, detection of ambiguities, and identification critical issues in system models. Temporal logic formulae are the natural choice when it comes to formalise requirements associated to desired system behaviours. [Question/problem] Understanding and mastering temporal logic requires a formal background. Means are therefore needed to make temporal logic formulae interpretable by engineers, domain experts and other stakeholders involved in the development process. [Principal ideas/results] In this paper, we propose to use a neural machine translation tool, named OPENNMT, to translate Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulae into corresponding natural language descriptions. Our results show that the translation system achieves an average BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score of 93.53\%, which corresponds to high-quality translations. [Contribution] Our neural model can be applied to assess if requirements have been correctly formalised. This can be useful to requirements analysts, who may have limited confidence with LTL, and to other stakeholders involved in the requirements verification process. Overall, our research preview contributes to bridging the gap between formal methods and requirements engineering, and opens to further research in explainable formal methods.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates how firms configure their business process management efforts in different industries. We generate a business process management (BPM) skills taxonomy through the computational linguistic analysis of job ads from . We apply the taxonomy to resumes of professionals employed at retailer Walmart, pharmaceutical company Pfizer, and investment bank Goldman Sachs. We find that Walmart and Pfizer distribute change- and operations-related BPM skills among the same roles whereas Goldman Sachs distributes both kinds of skills among more separate roles. This separation reflects a trilateral configuration where line managers and analysts focus on operational BPM tasks related to running processes while change-related tasks are covered by project managers. At Walmart and Pfizer the tasks of the BPM project manager are shared among managers and analysts, reflecting a bilateral configuration. Comparing each firm’s regulatory environments and BPM technology capabilities, we conjecture that the organizational configuration pattern is influenced by a firm’s ability to reliably automate business processes, since this affects how much attention line managers and analysts have to spend on monitoring processes and on reconciling issues and exceptions. This attention could otherwise be spent on regulatory-imposed process change efforts. This configural logic suggests a reconfiguration of BPM professionals towards a bilateral configuration when an organization transforms its business with digital technology, because the focus of such efforts includes process and decision automation.},

However, existing data that could support this activity is usually not accurate (because of possible human errors), incomplete, late, and scattered across various information systems in a typical hospital. Yet, in the case of cardiac patients, ensuring a prompt, smooth and continuous care delivery becomes extremely important and motivates improvement of data support for patient flow management activities. This paper presents the development of a location-aware business process management system (LA-BPMS) for monitoring a cardiac care delivery process in a hospital and in real-time. The system provides a better visibility of process execution to patient flow managers who can rely on accurate and real-time information about patient process states, as well as wait time measurements to control patient flow efficiently. We show how an intelligent approach of combining location awareness and business process automation allow this to be possible. A real cardiac care process from an Ontario hospital is used as an example.},

A further aim is to evaluate the understanding of the term BPM in the field. The findings result from a mixed-method approach combining qualitative and quantitative empirical methods. The qualitative study collected data carrying out 20 interviews in 11 enterprises. On the basis of these findings, a web-questionnaire for the quantitative study was developed. In order to evaluate the maturity levels, an adapted version of Hammers Process and Enterprise Maturity Model (PEMM) had to be developed. Data collected within quantitative research suggests higher maturity levels in comparison with data collected within qualitative research. A weak statistical connection between maturity level and economic success can be found. However, the data suggest that there is a lack in common understanding of the term business process management in praxis. Due to the reactivity of qualitative interviews a different sample may provide other findings. Whilst accessibility is a considerable advantage of web-surveys, a disadvantage of web-surveys is the lack of regulation of the sample. Hence, the findings of this study are not statistically representative for all SMEs.},

  abstract = {Agility is considered as a key concept to increase flexibility in company environments. Especially in times of digital disruptions, attempts are made to transfer the software engineering methods and rules (e.g., SCRUM) to other processes from other domains without having BPM standards so far. This article collected 17 known agility models relevant for BPM based on a literature review. Twelve essential dimensions to increase agility are described (e.g., communication, technology, process team, change), which might serve with specific values (e.g., frequency, channel and structure) as potential development paths for increasing agility in business processes.},

By utilizing Business Process Management Systems (BPMS), organizations can streamline and automate tasks, reduce turnaround time, and help ensure regulatory compliance. The foremost considerations when enterprises deploy BPM solutions involve supportive system functions, friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and maximal Return on Investment (ROI), based on the specific processes required, organizational management, and working style of their particular business environment. In order to address the problems associated with BPMS customization, for the flexible coverage of various requirements, this paper takes a three step approach. First, limited customization support of commercial and academic BPMS is reviewed in favor of open source BPMS. Then, advantageous features of uEngine, an open source BPMS which supports flexible customization, are introduced. Finally, API-based and component-based customization in building a BPM application utilizing uEngine is introduced with illustrative examples.},

  abstract = {Business process modelling languages typically enable the representation of business process models by employing (graphical) symbols. These symbols can vary depending upon the verbosity of the language, the modelling paradigm, the focus of the language and so on. To make explicit different constructs and rules employed by a specific language, as well as bridge the gap across different languages, meta-models have been proposed in the literature. These meta-models are a crucial source of knowledge on what state-of-the-art literature considers relevant to describe business processes. The goal of this work is to provide the first extensive systematic literature review (SLR) of business process meta-models. This SLR aims to answer research questions concerning: (1) the kind of meta-models proposed in the literature, (2) the recurring constructs they contain, (3) their purposes and (4) their evaluations. The SRL was performed manually considering papers automatically retrieved from reference paper repositories as well as proceedings of the main conferences in the Business Process Management research area. Sixty-five papers were selected and evaluated against four research questions. The results indicate the existence of a reasonable body of work conducted in this specific area, but not a full maturity. In particular, in answering the research questions several challenges have (re-)emerged for the Business Process Community, concerning: (1) the type of elements that constitute a Business Process and their meaning, (2) the absence of a (or several) reference meta-model(s) for the community, (3) the purpose for which meta-models are introduced in the literature and (4) a framework for the evaluation of the meta-models themselves. Moreover, the classification framework devised to answer the four research questions can provide a reference structure for future descriptive categorizations.},

We then transform this specification into a Petri Net workflow model and, separately, an Event B specification. The former models can be submitted to further behavioural analysis to ensure, for instance, satisfaction of liveness and safety properties. The latter specifications are important as we can use theorem proving techniques to check and refine data representation with respect to process evolution. An important property of the transformation is semantic equivalence between the Petri net model and Event-B model.},

However, the BPMN metamodel lacks formal specification of well-formed rules. In this context, we propose an object constraint language (OCL)-based approach to enhance the expressivity of the BPMN model to hold the information needed and to express resource allocation constraints. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm that verifies if the BPMN model has bad marks in order to verify the correctness of the enhanced model. The whole approach has been tested in the medical field. In particular, it has been used to model, check and improve the care process of a mobile hospital.},

It provides a robust structure of workflow and supports the flexibility of workflow enactment and evolution especially in a collaborative environment. To facilitate and foster business collaborations, the customisation, privacy protection, and authority control of business processes are essential. Given the diverse requirements of different roles involved in business processes, providing various views with adequate process information is critical to effective business process management. Several approaches have been proposed to construct views for traditional process-centric business processes; however, no approach has been developed for artifact-centric processes. The declarative manner of process modelling in artifact-centric approaches makes view construction challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel process view framework for artifact-centric business processes. The framework consists of artifact-centric process models, view models, and a mechanism to derive views from underlying process models. Consistency rules are also defined to preserve the consistency between a constructed view and its base process model.},

This course is designed to introduce students to qualitative approaches relevant to the study of media and communication. We will focus on a variety of philosophical and conceptual approaches, as well as practical methodologies and tools that will help students conduct qualitative scholarly research in their area of interest. The major methods of study will include text-based analyses, visual methods, ethnography/participant observation, historical analysis, interviews, and approaches to digital media. In addition to writings on epistemological and ethical issues, we will also critically examine the application of qualitative methods by way of recent studies of media audiences, industries, and texts.},

  abstract = {The “standing on the shoulders of giants” metaphor is often used to acknowledge the work of others when undertaking research and, in particular, stresses the importance of literature reviews in scientific inquiry. Though the significance of literature reviews has never been in doubt, researchers, especially novice researchers, still struggle with developing effective strategies for reviewing literature. An important reason for this difficulty is the rapidly increasing number of potentially relevant publications—not all of which necessarily add value to a literature review. As such, avoiding standing on the shoulders of dwarfs literature search emerges as a major issue in crafting an effective literature review. In this paper, we discuss challenges of literature searches in the increasingly dynamic context of information systems (IS) research and make recommendations for how to deal with them. We present practical guidelines and a checklist to help researchers with planning and organizing their literature searches.},
