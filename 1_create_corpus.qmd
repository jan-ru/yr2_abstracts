**WS8 Regulatory Instability, Business Process Management Technology, and BPM Skill Configurations (@DBLP:conf/bpm/LohmannM19)**

This paper investigates how firms configure their business process management efforts in different industries. We generate a business process management (BPM) skills taxonomy through the computational linguistic analysis of job ads from Monster.com . We apply the taxonomy to LinkedIn.com resumes of professionals employed at retailer Walmart, pharmaceutical company Pfizer, and investment bank Goldman Sachs. We find that Walmart and Pfizer distribute change- and operations-related BPM skills among the same roles whereas Goldman Sachs distributes both kinds of skills among more separate roles. This separation reflects a trilateral configuration where line managers and analysts focus on operational BPM tasks related to running processes while change-related tasks are covered by project managers. At Walmart and Pfizer the tasks of the BPM project manager are shared among managers and analysts, reflecting a bilateral configuration. Comparing each firm's **regulatory** environments and BPM technology capabilities, we conjecture that the organizational configuration pattern is influenced by a firm's ability to reliably automate business processes, since this affects how much attention line managers and analysts have to spend on monitoring processes and on reconciling issues and exceptions. This attention could otherwise be spent on regulatory-imposed process change efforts. This configural logic suggests a reconfiguration of BPM professionals towards a bilateral configuration when an organization transforms its business with digital technology, because the focus of such efforts includes process and decision automation.

**WS9 SEMPA - A Semantic Business Process Management Approach for the Planning of Process Models (@heinrichSEMPAAnsatzSemantischen2008)**

Full text article not accesible (wirtschaftsinformatick) & German

Currently process modeling is mostly done manually. Therefore, the initial design of process models as well as changes to process models which are frequently necessary to react to new market developments or new **regulations** are time-consuming tasks. In this paper we introduce SEMPA, an approach for the partly automatic planning of process models. Using ontologies to semantically describe actions - as envisioned in Semantic Business Process Management -, a process model for a specified problem setting can be created automatically. In comparison to existing planning algorithms our approach creates process models including control structures and is able to cope with complex and numerical input and output parameters of actions. The prototypical implementation as well as an example taken from the financial services domain illustrate the practical benefit of our approach.

**WS11 The influence of BPM-supportive culture and individual process orientation on process conformance (@benraadInfluenceBPMsupportiveCulture2022)**

Purpose Organizations rely on their business processes to achieve their business objectives and ensure **compliance** with relevant laws and regulations. Hence, conformance to process specifications is essential to remain compliant. Various factors influence an organization's ability to operate in conformance to its process specifications. This study investigates the influence of business process management (BPM**-supportive culture and individual process orientation on process conformance. Design/methodology/approach A construct was created for perceived process conformance and two constructs were selected from literature to represent BPM-supportive culture and individual process orientation. A survey was conducted with 178 employees of a global enterprise, hypotheses were formulated, and a statistical model was constructed and validated. Findings Results pinpoint the key role of the BPM-supportive culture in influencing both individual process orientation and conformance. Individual process orientation is also found to have a significant influence on process conformance. The findings provide additional evidence for the significance of human-related aspects of BPM in achieving BPM success. Originality/value The contributions of this paper help better understand how soft factors of BPM contribute to employees' process conformance drawing on and relating concepts of BPM and organizational routines.

**WS13 The Biggest Business Process Management Problems of Our Time (@beerepootBiggestBusinessProcess2021)**

in additional? it doesn't mention cross organizational processes?

It may be tempting for researchers to stick to incremental extensions of their current work to plan future research activities. Yet there is also merit in realizing the grand challenges in oneâ€™s field. This paper presents an overview of the nine major research problems for the Business Process Management discipline. These challenges have been collected by an open call to the community, discussed and refined in a workshop setting, and described here in detail, including a motivation why these problems are worth investigating. This overview may serve the purpose of inspiring both novice and advanced scholars who are interested in the radical new ideas for the analysis, design, and management of work processes using information technology.

**SD2 From policy implementation to business process management: Principles for creating flexibility and agility (@gongPolicyImplementationBusiness2012)**

Organizations are required to comply with changes in legislation and policy. Yet the implementation of new legislation is often expensive, can have long lead times and is prone to failure. The existing situation significantly constrains policy-making. To improve this, policy makers and policy executors are searching for ways to achieve higher levels of flexibility and agility in their business process management systems. Flexibility is the ability to react to changes and agility is the speed in responding to variety and change. Both flexibility and agility are multi-dimensional concepts.  
This paper presents principles for creating flexibility and agility when implementing new or revised policies into business processes. These principles include: 1) defining and using business services, 2) integrating and orchestrating business services through the use of events, 3) separating process, knowledge and resources and 4) implementing policy in an integrated manner. Business services are components encapsulating business functions and having clear responsibilities and accountabilities. The case study shows that these forms of flexibility and agility can help to implement policies more quickly and cost effectively. An organization's resources and level of flexibility and agility determines what laws can be implemented within a certain time. The improvement of flexibility and agility requires innovations on all levels: infrastructure, business process and organization. The level of flexibility and agility should always be measured by a combination of measures. We make plea for instruments assessing the impact of policies on organizations prior to implementation.

**SD4 Improving Telemedicine Processes Via BPM (@ilahiImprovingTelemedicineProcesses2013)**

BPM is an emerging theme that plays an important role in the global market of Business Processes. An efficient Management of Business Processes is able to ensure the requested development and competitiveness. A company which will be based on Business Process Management will provide a climate favoring the cooperation of its employees; they will be engaged in realizing well-defined tasks leading to an effective achievement of its objectives.  
Although telemedicine is an emerging successful field, it still suffers from problems of understanding, lack of techniques and legal texts and huge costs, and is still rarely used especially in Tunisia. Hence, the importance of process modeling and discovery of relevant technological means facilitating their use and automation. In this work, we designed, developed and tested a solution deploying Teleconsulting Process and remote diagnosis through a BPMS (Business Process Management System) that ensures their automation based on BPMN 2.0 models.
