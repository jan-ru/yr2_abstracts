bevilacquaBusinessProcessReengineering2012 (@Business Process Reengineering of Emergency Management Procedures: A Case Study)

The production and storage of dangerous substances in an industrial establishment creates risks for man, environment and properties in the surrounding area. Safety regulations require the establishment of a preventive information campaign regarding industrial risks and self-defence measures to adopt in an emergency situation. In the case of a major accident, people must be promptly made aware of the appropriate self-defence actions and behaviours to adopt. This strategic activity can reduce the panic effect, make citizens more cooperative and guarantee the effectiveness of any emergency plan. In this paper, the information chain is studied as an industrial process modelled by the IDEF0 language. Through this method, each link in the chain has been deeply analysed. For each function of the process, the inputs, outputs and necessary controls and resources have been identified. Starting from a clear view of the current state, the process of re-engineering has been implemented to minimise or eliminate downtime, deficiencies and illnesses and, thus, consequent time losses. The main contribution of the IDEF0 application in emergency management is to provide a clear view of the whole system, a communication system between emergency actors, a rich information source and a structured base for the re-engineering process.

viriyasitavatBlockchainasaServiceBusinessProcess2023 (@Blockchain-as-a-Service for Business Process Management: Survey and Challenges)

Blockchain technology (BCT) has brought a paradigm shift to Business Process Management (\hl{BPM}). BCT provides a trusted decentralized infrastructure to secure data and process executions using distributed ledgers and smart contract to manage complex business processes. Numerous efforts have been made to exploit BCT in supporting dynamic and trusted collaborations of business processes. This paper aims to understand recent BCT development for its \hl{BPM} applications and identify the limitations and challenges for further development via a systematic literature review (SLR). It is found that numerous works have reported using BCT as technical solutions to fulfill some traditional \hl{BPM} functions. This paper is distinguished from existing works, especially several relevant surveys in the sense that (1) the impact of using BCT in \hl{BPM} is thoroughly explored to identify new constraints and challenges explicitly brought by blockchains; (2) the requirements for Business Process \hl{compliance} (BPC) are firstly analyzed in detail. Note that BPC is to assure the adherence of business processes to pre-defined policies, standards, specifications, regulations, and laws when business processes are executed. To fill the gaps of BCT applications in these two aspects, Blockchain-as-aService (BCaaS) is adopted in business process architecture, and the trends of BCT developments are identified accordingly.

vanderfeestenProductbasedWorkflowSupport2011 (@Product-Based \hl{workflow} Support)

Despite the industrial need for the improvement of information-intensive business processes, few scientifically grounded approaches exist to support such initiatives. In this paper, we propose a new approach that builds on concepts that are part of a product-oriented view on process optimization. Essentially, this approach allows end users to flexibly decide on the best possible way to create an informational product within the limits that are imposed by regulations and logical dependencies. We argue that this provides various benefits in comparison to earlier work. To support the end user in making sensible decisions, we describe two alternative approaches to provide her with recommendations to this end. We formalize these alternatives and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. The feasibility of the overall approach, which we refer to as Product-Based \hl{workflow} Support, is demonstrated by a \hl{workflow} system realized using ProM and DECLARE.

DBLP:journals/rigaacs/KoncevicsPGDBA17 (@Comparative Analysis of Business Process Modelling Tools for \hl{compliance} Management Support)

The paper presents results of the comparative analysis of business process modelling tools for supporting automated \hl{compliance} management in organisations. By **\hl{compliance}** in the paper we mean \hl{compliance} to legislation, **regulations** of municipalities, external regulatory requirements and also internal organisational policies. The goal of the research is (1) to identify main attributes of business process modelling tools relevant in \hl{compliance} management, and (2) to use the identified attributes for analysis of the tools to better understand the scope of their capability to support \hl{compliance} management. The attributes of the tools have been derived from the related research. The analysis of the tools has been performed by installing each tool and evaluating it against a set of the identified attributes. The obtained results are useful in choosing the tools for \hl{compliance} management in general and for open source solutions to develop new \hl{compliance} management tools in particular.

kirKnowledgeintensiveAdaptiveBusiness2021 (@A Knowledge-Intensive Adaptive Business Process Management Framework)

Business process management has been the driving force of optimization and operational efficiency for companies until now, but the digitalization era we have been experiencing requires businesses to be agile and responsive as well. In order to be a part of this digital transformation, delivering new levels of automation-fueled agility through digitalization of \hl{BPM} itself is required. However, the automation of \hl{BPM} cannot be achieved by solely focusing on process space and classical planning techniques. It requires a holistic approach that also captures the social aspects of the business environment, such as corporate strategies, organization policies, negotiations, and cooperation. For this purpose, we combine \hl{BPM}, knowledge-intensive systems and intelligent agent technologies, and yield one consolidated intelligent business process management framework, namely agileBPM, that governs the entire \hl{BPM} life-cycle. Accordingly, agileBPM proposes a modeling methodology to semantically capture the business interests, enterprise environment and process space in accordance with the agent-oriented software engineering paradigm. The proposed agent-based process execution environment provides cognitive capabilities (such as goal-driven planning, norm \hl{compliance}, knowledge-driven actions, and dynamic cooperation) on top of the developed business models to support knowledge workers' multi-criteria decision making tasks. The context awareness and exception handling capabilities of the proposed approach have been presented with experimental studies. Through comparative evaluations, it is shown that agileBPM is the most comprehensive knowledge-intensive process management solution.

DBLP:phd/de/Awad2010 (@A \hl{compliance} Management Framework for Business Process Models)

Companies develop process models to explicitly describe their business operations. In the same time, business operations, business processes, must adhere to various types of \hl{compliance} requirements. **Regulations**, e.g., Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, internal policies, best practices are just a few sources of \hl{compliance} requirements. In some cases, non-adherence to \hl{compliance} requirements makes the organization subject to legal punishment. In other cases, non-adherence to \hl{compliance} leads to loss of competitive advantage and thus loss of market share. Unlike the classical domain-independent behavioral correctness of business processes, \hl{compliance} requirements are domain-specific. Moreover, \hl{compliance} requirements change over time. New requirements might appear due to change in laws and adoption of new policies. \hl{compliance} requirements are offered or enforced by different entities that have different objectives behind these requirements. Finally, \hl{compliance} requirements might affect different aspects of business processes, e.g., control flow and data flow. As a result, it is infeasible to hard-code \hl{compliance} checks in tools. Rather, a repeatable process of modeling \hl{compliance} rules and checking them against business processes automatically is needed. This thesis provides a formal approach to support process design-time \hl{compliance} checking. Using visual patterns, it is possible to model \hl{compliance} requirements concerning control flow, data flow and conditional flow rules. Each pattern is mapped into a temporal logic formula. The thesis addresses the problem of consistency checking among various \hl{compliance} requirements, as they might stem from divergent sources. Also, the thesis contributes to automatically check \hl{compliance} requirements against process models using model checking. We show that extra domain knowledge, other than expressed in \hl{compliance} rules, is needed to reach correct decisions. In case of violations, we are able to provide a useful feedback to the user. The feedback is in the form of parts of the process model whose execution causes the violation. In some cases, our approach is capable of providing automated remedy of the violation.

vanderaaComparingTextualDescriptions2017 (@Comparing Textual Descriptions to Process Models -- The Automatic Detection of Inconsistencies)

Many organizations maintain textual process descriptions alongside graphical process models. The purpose is to make process information accessible to various stakeholders, including those who are not familiar with reading and interpreting the complex execution logic of process models. Despite this merit, there is a clear risk that model and text become misaligned when changes are not applied to both descriptions consistently. For organizations with hundreds of different processes, the effort required to identify and clear up such conflicts is considerable. To support organizations in keeping their process descriptions consistent, we present an approach to automatically identify inconsistencies between a process model and a corresponding textual description. Our approach detects cases where the two process representations describe activities in different orders and detect process model activities not contained in the textual description. A quantitative evaluation with 53 real-life model-text pairs demonstrates that our approach accurately identifies inconsistencies between model and text.

lyComplianceMonitoringBusiness2015 (@\hl{compliance} Monitoring in Business Processes: Functionalities, Application, and Tool-Support)

In recent years, monitoring the \hl{compliance} of business processes with relevant regula- tions, constraints, and rules during runtime has evolved as major concern in literature and practice. Monitoring not only refers to continuously observing possible \hl{compliance} violations, but also includes the ability to provide fine-grained feedback and to predict possible \hl{compliance} violations in the future. The body of literature on business process \hl{compliance} is large and approaches specifically addressing process monitoring are hard to identify. Moreover, proper means for the systematic comparison of these approaches are missing. Hence, it is unclear which approaches are suitable for particular scenarios. The goal of this paper is to define a framework for \hl{compliance} Monitoring Functionalities (CMF) that enables the systematic comparison of existing and new approaches for monitoring \hl{compliance} rules over business processes during runtime. To define the scope of the framework, at first, related areas are identified and discussed. The CMFs are harvested based on a systematic literature review and five selected case studies. The appropriateness of the selection of CMFs is demonstrated in two ways: (a) a systematic comparison with pattern-based \hl{compliance} approaches and (b) a classification of existing \hl{compliance} monitoring approaches using the CMFs. Moreover, the application of the CMFs is showcased using three existing tools that are applied to two realistic data sets. Overall, the CMF framework provides powerful means to position existing and future \hl{compliance} monitoring approaches.

zasadaEvaluationComplianceRule2023 (@Evaluation of \hl{compliance} Rule Languages for Modelling Regulatory \hl{compliance} Requirements)

\hl{compliance} in business processes has become a fundamental requirement given the constant rise in regulatory requirements and competitive pressures that have emerged in recent decades. While in other areas of business process modelling and execution, considerable progress towards automation has been made (e.g., process discovery, executable process models), the interpretation and implementation of \hl{compliance} requirements is still a highly complex task requiring human effort and time. To increase the level of ``mechanization'' when implementing regulations in business processes, \hl{compliance} research seeks to formalize \hl{compliance} requirements. Formal representations of \hl{compliance} requirements should, then, be leveraged to design correct process models and, ideally, would also serve for the automated detection of violations. To formally specify \hl{compliance} requirements, however, multiple process perspectives, such as control flow, data, time and resources, have to be considered. This leads to the challenge of representing such complex constraints which affect different process perspectives. To this end, current approaches in business process \hl{compliance} make use of a varied set of languages. However, every approach has been devised based on different assumptions and motivating scenarios. In addition, these languages and their presentation usually abstract from real-world requirements which often would imply introducing a substantial amount of domain knowledge and interpretation, thus hampering the evaluation of their expressiveness. This is a serious problem, since comparisons of different formal languages based on real-world \hl{compliance} requirements are lacking, meaning that users of such languages are not able to make informed decisions about which language to choose. To close this gap and to establish a uniform evaluation basis, we introduce a running example for evaluating the expressiveness and complexity of \hl{compliance} rule languages. For language selection, we conducted a literature review. Next, we briefly introduce and demonstrate the languages' grammars and vocabularies based on the representation of a number of legal requirements. In doing so, we pay attention to semantic subtleties which we evaluate by adopting a normative classification framework which differentiates between different deontic assignments. Finally, on top of that, we apply Halstead's well-known metrics for calculating the relevant characteristics of the different languages in our comparison, such as the volume, difficulty and effort for each language. With this, we are finally able to better understand the lexical complexity of the languages in relation to their expressiveness. In sum, we provide a systematic comparison of different \hl{compliance} rule languages based on real-world \hl{compliance} requirements which may inform future users and developers of these languages. Finally, we advocate for a more user-aware development of \hl{compliance} languages which should consider a trade off between expressiveness, complexity and usability.

hashmiAreWeDone2018 (@Are We Done with Business Process \hl{compliance}: State of the Art and Challenges Ahead)

Literature on business process \hl{compliance} (BPC) has predominantly focused on the alignment of the regulatory rules with the design, verification and validation of business processes. Previously surveys on BPC have been conducted with specific context in mind; however, the literature on BPC management research is largely sparse and does not accumulate a detailed understanding on existing literature and related issues faced by the domain. This survey provides a holistic view of the literature on existing BPC management approaches, and categories them based on different \hl{compliance} management strategies in the context of formulated research questions. A systematic literature approach is used where search terms pertaining keywords were used to identify literature related to the research questions from scholarly databases. From initially 183 papers, we selected 79 papers related to the themes of this survey published between 2000--2015. The survey results reveal that mostly \hl{compliance} management approaches center around three distinct categories namely: design-time (28%), run-time (32%) and auditing (10%). Also, organisational and internal control based \hl{compliance} management frameworks (21%) and hybrid approaches make (9%) of the surveyed approaches. Furthermore, open research challenges and gaps are identified and discussed with respect to the \hl{compliance} problem.

holzmuller-laueImprovedComplianceBPMDriven2014 (@Improved \hl{compliance} by \hl{BPM}-Driven \hl{workflow} Automation)

Using methods and technologies of business process management (\hl{BPM}) for the laboratory automation has important benefits (i.e., the agility of high-level automation processes, rapid interdisciplinary prototyping and implementation of laboratory tasks and procedures, and efficient real-time process documentation). A principal goal of the model-driven development is the improved transparency of processes and the alignment of process diagrams and technical code. First experiences of using the business process model and notation (BPMN) show that easy-to-read graphical process models can achieve and provide standardization of laboratory workflows. The model-based development allows one to change processes quickly and an easy adaption to changing requirements. The process models are able to host work procedures and their scheduling in \hl{compliance} with predefined guidelines and policies. Finally, the process-controlled documentation of complex \hl{workflow} results addresses modern laboratory needs of quality assurance. BPMN 2.0 as an automation language to control every kind of activity or subprocess is directed to complete workflows in end-to-end relationships. BPMN is applicable as a system-independent and cross-disciplinary graphical language to document all methods in laboratories (i.e., screening procedures or analytical processes). That means, with the \hl{BPM} standard, a communication method of sharing process knowledge of laboratories is also available.

voRecognizingSplittingConditional2021 (@Recognizing and Splitting Conditional Sentences for Automation of Business Processes Management)

Business Process Management (\hl{BPM}) is the discipline which is responsible for management of discovering, analyzing, redesigning, monitoring, and controlling business processes. One of the most crucial tasks of \hl{BPM} is discovering and modelling business processes from text documents. In this paper, we present our system that resolves an end-to-end problem consisting of 1) recognizing conditional sentences from technical documents, 2) finding boundaries to extract conditional and resultant clauses from each conditional sentence, and 3) categorizing resultant clause as Action or Consequence which later helps to generate new steps in our business process model automatically. We created a new dataset and three models solve this problem. Our best model achieved very promising results of 83.82, 87.84, and 85.75 for Precision, Recall, and F1, respectively, for extracting Condition, Action, and Consequence clauses using Exact Match metric.

elgammalBusinessProcessCompliance2014 (@Business Process \hl{compliance} Management: An Integrated Proactive Approach)

Today's enterprises demand a high degree of \hl{compliance} of business processes to meet regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley and Basel I-III. To ensure continuous guaranteed \hl{compliance}, \hl{compliance} management should be considered during all phases of the business process lifecycle; from the analysis and design to deployment, monitoring and evaluation. This paper introduces an integrated business process \hl{compliance} management framework that incorporates design-time verification and runtime monitoring approaches. The nutshell of the approach is the \hl{compliance} Request Language (CRL), which is a high-level pattern-based language for the abstract specification of \hl{compliance} requirements. From CRL expressions, formal \hl{compliance} rules can be automatically generated, thereby eliminating the need for business and \hl{compliance} experts to learn and use complex low-level formal languages. Formalized \hl{compliance} rules enable automated approaches to be used for the static verification and dynamic monitoring of business processes. An integrated prototypical tool-suite is developed as a proof-of-concept to help validating the applicability of the approaches, and validated by experiment with two real-life case studies.

Purpose -- In organizations, individual user's \hl{compliance} with business processes is important from a regulatory and efficiency point of view. The restriction of users' choices by implementing a restrictive information system is a typical approach in many organizations. However, restrictions and mandated \hl{compliance} may affect employees' performance negatively. Especially when users need a certain degree of flexibility in completing their work activity. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of directive explanations (DEs). DEs provide context-dependent feedback to users, but do not force users to comply.

hashmi2017norms (@Norms Modeling Constructs of Business Process \hl{compliance} Management Frameworks: A Conceptual Evaluation)

The effectiveness of a \hl{compliance} management framework (CMF) can be guaranteed only if the framework is based on sound conceptual and formal foundations. In particular, the formal language used in the CMF is able to expressively represent the specifications of normative requirements (hereafter, norms) that impose constraints on various activities of a business process. However, if the language used lacks expressiveness and the modelling constructs proposed in the CMF are not able to properly represent different types of norms, it can significantly impede the reliability of the \hl{compliance} results produced by the CMF. This paper investigates whether existing CMFs are able to provide reasoning and modeling support for various types of normative requirements by evaluating the conceptual foundations of the modeling constructs that existing CMFs use to represent a specific type of norm. The evaluation results portray somewhat a bleak picture of the state-of-the-affairs when it comes to represent norms as none of the existing CMFs is able to provide a comprehensive reasoning and modeling support. Also, it points to the shortcomings of the CMFs and emphasises exigent need of new modeling languages with sound theoretical and formal foundations for representing legal norms.

DBLP:conf/\hl{BPM}/RamezaniFA13 (@Supporting Domain Experts to Select and Configure Precise \hl{compliance} Rules)

\hl{compliance} specifications concisely describe selected aspects of what a business operation should adhere to. To enable automated techniques for \hl{compliance} checking, it is important that these requirements are specified correctly and precisely, describing exactly the behavior intended. Although there are rigorous mathematical formalisms for representing \hl{compliance} rules, these are often perceived to be difficult to use for business users. Regardless of notation, however, there are often subtle but important details in \hl{compliance} requirements that need to be considered. The main challenge in \hl{compliance} checking is to bridge the gap between informal description and a precise specification of all requirements. In this paper, we present an approach which aims to facilitate creating and understanding formal \hl{compliance} requirements by providing configurable templates that capture these details as options for commonly-required \hl{compliance} requirements. These options are configured interactively with end-users, using question trees and natural language. The approach is implemented in the Process Mining Toolkit ProM.

viriyasitavatBlockchainbasedBusinessProcess2020 (@Blockchain-Based Business Process Management (\hl{BPM}) Framework for Service Composition in Industry 4.0)

Business process management (\hl{BPM}) aims to optimize business processes to achieve better system performance such as higher profit, quicker response, and better services. \hl{BPM} systems in Industry 4.0 are required to digitize and automate business process workflows and support the transparent interoperations of service vendors. The critical bottleneck to advance \hl{BPM} systems is the evaluation, verification, and transformation of trustworthiness and digitized assets. Most of \hl{BPM} systems rely heavily on domain experts or third parties to deal with trustworthiness. In this paper, an automated \hl{BPM} solution is investigated to select and compose services in open business environment, Blockchain technology (BCT) is explored and proposed to transfer and verify the trustiness of businesses and partners, and a \hl{BPM} framework is developed to illustrate how BCT can be integrated to support prompt, reliable, and cost-effective evaluation and transferring of Quality of Services in the \hl{workflow} composition and management.

raucciBPMPerspectivesSupport2020 (@\hl{BPM} Perspectives to Support ICSs: Exploiting the Integration of Formal Verifications into Investment Service Provision Processes)

Purpose This paper investigates the criteria for a selective integration, in the multidisciplinary business process management (\hl{BPM}) areas, between information technologies tools and the company's internal control systems (ICSs) aimed at directing organizational behaviours. Adopting a process-based perspective, the authors propose a formal methodology to increase ICSs aims, related to the segregation of duties (SoDs) models, efficiently and effectively. Design/methodology/approach The authors examine the applicability of formal verifications to validate a banking process of providing investment services, which is mapped through the \hl{workflow} management system. To mitigate the state explosion problem of formal methods, the authors propose an efficient methodology that has been proved on the SoDs models in the bank ICSs, as a case study. Findings The authors' investigations suggest that in the \hl{BPM} domain, the banking ICSs aims can benefit from the aforesaid methodologies, originating from the formal methods area, to increase the reliability and correctness in the design, modelling and implementation of the SoDs models. Originality/value The proposed methodology is quite general and can be efficiently applied to large-scale systems in different business contexts or areas of the \hl{BPM}. Its application to the bank's SoD prevents or detects significant weaknesses, operational risks, excessive risk appetite and other undesirable behaviours in the investment services provision processes. This guarantees that the investment ordered/offered is ``suitable and appropriate'' with the client's risk profile, especially non-professional, required by the MiFID II Directive.

bernardojuniorAgileBusinessProcess2023 (@Toward Agile Business Process Management: Description of Concepts and a Proposed Definition)

Business Process Management (\hl{BPM}) needs to be adjusted quickly and flexibly to cope with the dynamics of the business environment, so the demand for the incorporation of agility has reached \hl{BPM}. To contribute to the theoretical consolidation of Agile \hl{BPM}, it is necessary to develop a conceptualization for the term, that is, to describe the essential attributes for its understanding. Communicating the meaning of the concept in reduced words occurs through the definition, so the main objective of this study is to develop a scientific definition for Agile \hl{BPM}. This study was performed in three phases. First, a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate how the scientific literature has addressed Agile \hl{BPM}. Next, a deductive analysis was performed to conceptualize Agile \hl{BPM}. In the third phase, a consultation with experts was conducted to refine the conceptual view and critique a tentative definition, preceded by judges' analysis to consolidate the definition. As a result, the concept of Agile \hl{BPM} was elaborated, and based on the reduction of this conceptualization, a scientific definition was presented which describes that Agile \hl{BPM} is ``the promotion of \hl{BPM} in which practitioners stimulate change quickly and flexibly in order to meet organizational demands with \hl{compliance} and provide a better customer experience''. There is a pioneering spirit in the present study regarding the deliberate conceptualization of Agile \hl{BPM}, which provides the basis for discussion of the topic, and helps scientific dissemination through a definition, contributing to the development of a theory of Agile \hl{BPM}.
